## Objective
This document consolidates the detailed research findings for Task 5.3, covering expertise classification methods, adaptation rules for monitoring, intervention, and visualization, and personalized monitoring configurations.

## 1. Expertise Classification Methods Considered

Based on the research (see `01_expertise_classification_prompts_responses.md`), the following methods and frameworks were identified:

### Frameworks for Defining Expertise Levels:
*   **Structured Skill Levels:** Beginner, Advanced Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert. (Source: Codility)
*   **Junior-Middle-Senior Model:** Trainee, Junior, Middle, Senior. (Source: Programmer Competency Matrix)
*   **Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition:** Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient, Expert. (Applied to software development)
*   **Seven Stages of Expertise (Meilir Page-Jones):** Focuses on productivity, detailed progression from novice to expert.

### Methods for Inferring/Measuring Expertise:
*   **Implicit Measures (Usage Patterns):**
    *   Frequency of advanced feature use.
    *   Efficient navigation and problem-solving approaches within the tool.
    *   Types of errors encountered or corrected.
    *   Data collected via usage analytics or IDE telemetry.
*   **Explicit User Self-Assessment:**
    *   Structured questionnaires or rating scales.
    *   Integrated into developer profiles (comfort with languages, frameworks, tools).
    *   Can be subjective but provides quick insights; best when cross-validated.
*   **Project Complexity / Role-based Assumptions:**
    *   Analysis of code repositories (quality, architecture, documentation).
    *   Contributions to open-source or high-impact codebases.
    *   Breadth and depth of technologies used.
    *   Performance metrics and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.
*   **Other Assessment Techniques (can be adapted):**
    *   Code Tests (relevant to tool usage).
    *   Technical Interviews (tool-specific workflows).
    *   Project Assignments (simulating tasks requiring tool proficiency).
    *   Past Work Analysis.
*   **Automated/Platform-Based Assessments:**
    *   Tools like Codility, HackerRank for coding ability and sometimes tool-specific tasks.

**Summary for Roo Code:** A hybrid approach seems most suitable, combining:
1.  **Initial Self-Assessment:** Simple (e.g., Novice, Intermediate, Expert) during profile setup.
2.  **Implicit Usage Pattern Analysis:** Track usage of Roo Code features (e.g., advanced debugging, custom rule creation, frequency of overrides) over time to refine the expertise level.
3.  **Optional Project Context:** Allow users to specify project complexity or their role, which can weigh into the expertise model.

## 2. Adaptation Rules Developed

Based on research (see `02_adaptation_rules_prompts_responses.md`), the following adaptation rules are proposed:

### 2.1. Adapting Error Monitoring:

*   **Novice Users:**
    *   **Tools/Guidance:** More guidance on using basic Roo Code features for error identification.
    *   **Feedback:** More immediate and verbose feedback on potential issues. Simpler language.
    *   **Scope:** Focus on common, simpler error types first.
*   **Intermediate Users:**
    *   **Dashboards/Analytics:** Access to customizable views of error data within Roo Code.
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Hints towards error patterns.
    *   **Integration:** Guidance on integrating Roo Code insights with CI/CD or other tools.
*   **Expert Users:**
    *   **Deep Dive Tools:** Access to advanced diagnostic information if Roo Code captures it.
    *   **Filtering/Prioritization:** More control over error filtering and prioritization. Less noise.
    *   **Custom Alerts:** Ability to define more specific or complex alert conditions.

### 2.2. Adapting Intervention Triggers (from Task 5.1):

*   **Novice Users:**
    *   **Frequency:** Lower threshold for intervention; more proactive suggestions and warnings.
    *   **Nature of Intervention:** More guided (e.g., "It looks like you might be X, here's a common way to fix it Y / a link to docs Z"). Step-by-step assistance for common errors.
    *   **Confirmation:** May require more explicit confirmation before Roo Code takes corrective actions.
*   **Intermediate Users:**
    *   **Frequency:** Balanced intervention; suggestions for less obvious issues or patterns.
    *   **Nature of Intervention:** Offer multiple potential solutions or approaches. Highlight trade-offs.
    *   **Confirmation:** More autonomy, but with clear "undo" or review options.
*   **Expert Users ("Weathered Engineers"):**
    *   **Frequency:** Higher threshold for intervention; focus on critical or systemic issues. Avoid interrupting flow for minor or stylistic issues unless explicitly configured.
    *   **Nature of Intervention:** Concise, technical information. Direct links to relevant code sections or advanced diagnostics. Assume user can self-correct with minimal guidance. "Pay attention" - highlight anomalies or deviations from expected patterns.
    *   **Confirmation:** High degree of autonomy. Interventions are more like advisories unless critical.

### 2.3. Adapting Visualization Details (from Task 5.2):

*   **Novice Users:**
    *   **Simplicity:** Clear, simple language. Less jargon.
    *   **Detail Level:** High-level summaries first, with clear paths to more details if needed. Avoid overwhelming with too much data at once.
    *   **Guidance:** Visual cues pointing to the most important information or next steps.
    *   **Example:** "This error often means X. Try checking Y."
*   **Intermediate Users:**
    *   **Balance:** Mix of summary and detailed views. Ability to drill down.
    *   **Context:** More contextual information (e.g., related errors, historical trends if available).
    *   **Customization:** Some ability to customize the visualization dashboard.
    *   **Example:** "Error A detected. Potential causes: X, Y. See stack trace [link] and related occurrences [link]."
*   **Expert Users:**
    *   **Conciseness & Density:** More informationally dense displays. Technical accuracy paramount.
    *   **Control:** High degree of control over what is displayed and how. Advanced filtering options.
    *   **Raw Data Access:** Option to view raw log data or detailed diagnostic outputs.
    *   **Example:** "Error A (Type: B) at C. Details: [technical_info]. Affected components: D, E."

## 3. Personalized Monitoring Configurations

Based on research (see `03_personalized_settings_prompts_responses.md`), users should be able to:

*   **Set Initial Expertise Level:**
    *   Options: "Novice" (more guidance, simpler UI), "Intermediate" (balanced), "Expert" (more control, concise info).
    *   This sets the baseline for adaptive behaviors.
*   **Customize Notification Preferences:**
    *   **Frequency:** How often to receive non-critical alerts (e.g., "Minimal", "Balanced", "Detailed").
    *   **Channels:** (If applicable, e.g., in-tool, email for critical alerts).
    *   **Types of Issues:** Allow users to opt-in/out of certain categories of non-critical suggestions (e.g., stylistic, performance hints vs. functional errors).
*   **Adjust Intervention Thresholds:**
    *   For experts: "Only intervene for high-severity issues" vs. "Provide suggestions for moderate issues too."
    *   For novices: "Guide me through most potential issues" vs. "Let me try first, then offer help."
*   **Control Visualization Density:**
    *   "Show me the basics" vs. "Show me all available technical details."
*   **Override AI Calibration:**
    *   Allow users to manually adjust their perceived expertise level if the AI's inference feels off.
    *   Provide feedback mechanism: "This suggestion was not helpful / too basic / too complex."
*   **Specific Feature Toggles:**
    *   Toggle specific types of AI assistance on/off (e.g., "Proactive code suggestions," "Automated error explanation").

**Example Configuration Options:**

*   **Global Expertise Setting:** [Novice | Intermediate | Expert] (Dropdown)
*   **Intervention Style:**
    *   [ ] Proactive suggestions for common errors
    *   [ ] Detailed explanations for errors
    *   [ ] Offer to auto-correct minor issues
    *   Threshold for intervention: [Low (frequent) | Medium | High (rare)] (Slider)
*   **Visualization Detail:**
    *   Error message verbosity: [Concise | Standard | Detailed] (Dropdown)
    *   [ ] Show advanced diagnostic panels by default
*   **"Vibe Coder" Mode (Preset for Novice/Early Intermediate):**
    *   High intervention, simple visualizations, strong guidance. "Set, forget, and if it works, I guess, use it." - implies a desire for the tool to handle more and provide clear, actionable, or even automated fixes.
*   **"Weathered Engineer" Mode (Preset for Expert):**
    *   Minimal intervention for non-critical issues, concise/technical visualizations, high user control. "Pay attention" - implies they want to be alerted to significant things but otherwise left to their own devices.

## 4. Integration with Roo Code (Considerations)

*   **User Profile System:**
    *   If Roo Code has user profiles, store expertise level and preferences there.
    *   If not, a simple local storage mechanism could hold these settings initially.
*   **Telemetry for Implicit Measures:**
    *   Roo Code would need to collect (anonymized, with consent) data on feature usage, error interactions, etc., to feed into an implicit expertise model. This is a more advanced feature.
*   **Initial Implementation:**
    *   Start with explicit self-assessment.
    *   Implement a few key adaptation rules for intervention frequency and visualization detail based on this self-assessment.
    *   Offer a basic set of personalization settings.
*   **Phased Rollout:**
    *   Phase 1: Self-selected expertise (Novice, Intermediate, Expert) with basic adaptations.
    *   Phase 2: Introduce more granular personalization settings.
    *   Phase 3 (Advanced): Develop implicit expertise modeling based on usage patterns.
