## Objective
Log the research and design process for creating the Validator mode for Roo Code.

## Log Entries

### Entry 1: Initial Research and Planning (2025-05-19)
**Action:** Attempted to query the memory-agent-sql for existing information.
**Prompts to Memory System:**
1.  `search_memories` with query: "specialized AI validation modes"
2.  `search_memories` with query: "Roo Code mode design principles"
3.  `search_memories` with query: "LLM for error detection"
4.  `search_memories` with query: "peer review patterns for AI agents"
**Results:** No relevant entries found in the memory system for these queries.
**Next Steps:** Proceed with design based on provided task context, custom instructions, and general knowledge. Begin drafting the `validator_mode_design_spec.md` document.

### Entry 2: Defining Validator Mode Role & Responsibilities (2025-05-19)
**Action:** Began outlining the core purpose, error focus, and interaction patterns for the Validator mode.

**Initial Thoughts on Role & Responsibilities:**
*   **Purpose:** Act as a critical reviewer of outputs from other Roo Code modes to enhance reliability and accuracy.
*   **Error Focus:**
    *   Semantic errors (misinterpretation of intent).
    *   Logical fallacies.
    *   Factual inaccuracies.
    *   Adherence to constraints (task-specific, project-wide like SPARC, citation rules).
    *   Code quality issues not caught by linters (e.g., code smells, architectural adherence).
    *   Completeness and coherence of outputs.
    *   Ethical considerations (alignment with `ethics_layer`).
    *   Basic security vulnerability checks (conceptual, not deep static analysis).
*   **Interaction with Other Modes:**
    *   Manual invocation by the user.
    *   Automatic triggering based on risk factors (e.g., high-impact tasks, low confidence from originating mode).
    *   Optional, configurable step in workflows post-specialist mode, pre-user presentation or Orchestrator hand-off.
    *   Orchestrator-driven routing for critical/complex tasks.

**(Further details will be added as the design progresses within validator_mode_design_spec.md and reflected here.)**
