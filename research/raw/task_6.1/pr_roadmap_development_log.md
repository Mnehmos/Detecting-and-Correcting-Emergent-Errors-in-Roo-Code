# PR Roadmap Development Log - Task 6.1

## 1. Objective
To create a prioritized roadmap of GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) for implementing the error detection and correction systems designed in Phases 0-5 of the Roo Code research project.

## 2. Process Overview
1.  **Review Synthesis Documents:** Systematically read all `*.md` files in the `research/synthesis/` directory to extract all proposed features, mechanisms, and system changes.
2.  **Identify Potential PRs:** For each proposed item, conceptualize one or more distinct PRs required for its implementation.
3.  **Define PR Specifications:** For each PR, detail its title, description, source research document(s), conceptual changes, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and a complexity estimate.
4.  **Prioritize PRs:** Group PRs into logical development phases based on foundational nature, impact, feasibility, and user-facing value.
5.  **Map Dependencies:** Explicitly note dependencies between PRs.
6.  **Document Roadmap:** Create the `pr_roadmap_error_systems.md` document.
7.  **Log Process:** Maintain this log file.

## 4. Prioritization Rationale & Phasing Strategy

The PR roadmap is structured into logical phases to ensure a manageable and incremental implementation of the proposed error detection and correction systems.

**Prioritization Factors Considered:**
1.  **Foundational Nature:** Components that are prerequisites for other features or establish core infrastructure.
2.  **Impact on Stability & Safety:** Features that directly address critical error handling, safety, or system robustness.
3.  **User-Facing Value:** Features that provide immediate and tangible benefits to the user experience.
4.  **Feasibility & Complexity:** Balancing early wins with more complex undertakings. Iterative development is preferred.
5.  **Logical Dependencies:** Ensuring that PRs are sequenced according to their technical dependencies.
6.  **Alignment with Core Project Goals:** Prioritizing features central to error detection, correction, and prevention.

**Phasing Strategy:**

*   **Phase A: Core Infrastructure & Foundational Safety:** Focuses on establishing essential error handling improvements, basic telemetry, the PR contribution framework, core structures for conditional auto-approval, task boundary enforcement, and the initial definition of the sandbox mode. This phase lays the groundwork for more advanced features.
*   **Phase B: Key Detection Mechanisms & Initial Integrations:** Implements core error detection systems like semantic guardrails, cross-task consistency checks, and basic cost anomaly detection. It also includes initial integrations of these systems with the CAA and the first operational aspects of the sandbox mode.
*   **Phase C: User Experience, Feedback Loops & Enhanced Safety:** Introduces user-facing elements like error visualization, the community error pattern library, the error feedback loop for prompt enhancement, expertise-adaptive monitoring, and UI for sandbox review. This phase aims to make the system more interactive and responsive.
*   **Phase D: Advanced Features, Refinements & Full Integration:** Encompasses the implementation of all remaining advanced features, comprehensive integration of all systems, and refinement based on initial feedback and usage. This includes full-featured CADS, CAA, telemetry, advanced sandbox capabilities, and sophisticated intervention points.

**Complexity Estimates:**
*   **Small:** Focused change, typically affecting 1-2 files or a small module. Can be completed relatively quickly.
*   **Medium:** Involves multiple components, a new small module, or significant changes to an existing module. Requires moderate effort.
*   **Large:** Represents a significant new system, major refactoring of existing systems, or complex integrations across multiple parts of the codebase. Requires substantial effort and planning.

This phased approach allows for iterative development, testing, and refinement, reducing risk and enabling the delivery of value incrementally.
