## Objective
This log documents the research activities, prompts used, responses received, and design considerations undertaken during the development of the Community PR-Based Error Correction Framework for Roo Code (Task 4.3).

## 1. Initial Memory System Consultation (Attempted)

*   **Action:** Attempted to query the `memory-agent-sql` MCP for existing information.
*   **Prompt 1 (Memory Search):**
    ```json
    {
      "query": "community PR workflows for AI projects"
    }
    ```
*   **Response 1:**
    ```
    Error: SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: memory_entries
    ```
*   **Note:** Due to the error, further memory consultations and updates were skipped for this task. The framework was developed based on fresh web research.

## 2. Research on Community Contribution Models

*   **Goal:** Investigate successful models for community code contributions in open-source projects, particularly AI/ML.
*   **Tool Used:** `brave-search` MCP
*   **Prompt 2 (Web Search):**
    ```json
    {
      "query": "best practices for community PR contributions in open source AI/ML projects"
    }
    ```
*   **Response 2 (Summary of Key Findings):**
    *   General open-source contribution guides are plentiful (e.g., DigitalOcean, OpenSource Guide, FreeCodeCamp).
    *   Specific AI/ML contribution discussions often focus on *where* to contribute (finding projects) and *what* to contribute (data, models, code).
    *   Key themes emerging:
        *   Importance of clear `CONTRIBUTING.md` files.
        *   Welcoming and supportive community.
        *   Guidance for beginners.

        *   Using draft PRs for early feedback.
    *   (Detailed search results were provided by the MCP and reviewed, informing the process design in the synthesis document).

## 6. Design Considerations for PR Templates

*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** Templates should be easy to understand and fill out.
*   **Completeness:** Ensure all necessary information for reviewing a fix is requested.
*   **Linkage:** Encourage linking to existing issues or error patterns.
*   **Guidance on "What to Provide":** Especially for AI-specific fixes (prompts, configurations), guide users on how to detail their changes.
*   **Testing Evidence:** Emphasize the need for clear steps on how the fix was tested and validated.
*   **Side Effect Awareness:** Prompt contributors to think about potential regressions.
*   **Two-Tiered Approach:**
    *   A comprehensive template for most bug fixes.
    *   A simpler template for trivial fixes (typos, minor doc updates) to reduce overhead.
*   **Checklist:** A self-check for contributors before submission.

## 7. Design Considerations for Contribution Guidelines

*   **Audience:** Target community members with varying levels of technical expertise.
*   **Scope:** Cover not just code, but also fixes to prompts, configurations, and documentation.
*   **Workflow:** Clearly outline the steps from finding a bug to getting a PR merged.
*   **Standards:** Define expectations for testing, documentation, and (if applicable) coding style.
*   **Communication:** Point to channels for help and discussion.
*   **Welcoming Tone:** Encourage contributions and set a positive tone.
*   **Accessibility:** Make the guidelines easy to find and read.

## 8. Design Considerations for Review and Integration Process

*   **Efficiency:** Streamline the process to avoid bottlenecks.
*   **Quality Control:** Ensure fixes are effective and don't introduce new issues.
*   **Community Engagement:** Involve community reviewers where appropriate to scale the review effort and foster ownership.
*   **Automation:** Leverage GitHub Actions or similar for automated checks.
*   **Maintainer Workload:** Design the process to be manageable for maintainers.
*   **Transparency:** Make the review criteria and process clear to contributors.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Ensure constructive feedback is provided and contributors can iterate.
*   **Merge Strategy:** Decide on a consistent merge strategy (e.g., squash, rebase).

## 9. Conceptual Example of a PR (Illustrative)

*This is a conceptual example to illustrate how a PR might look using the proposed template.*

**PR Title:** `fix: Corrects misinterpretation of user intent for date-related queries`

**Body (using `bug_fix.md` template):**

---

**1. Description of the Error**

*   **Summary:** The agent often misunderstands queries asking for information "next Tuesday" if "today" is a Monday, sometimes providing information for the *current* Tuesday instead of the *following* Tuesday.
*   **Related Issue(s):** `Fixes #789`
*   **Error Pattern Library Reference (if applicable):** `Addresses Pattern ID: ROO-E-015 (Ambiguous Temporal Reference)`
*   **Observed Behavior:** When asked on Monday, "What's the weather for next Tuesday?", the agent provides Monday's weather or the current day's Tuesday weather.
*   **Expected Behavior:** The agent should provide the weather forecast for the *upcoming* Tuesday (i.e., 8 days from the Monday query).
*   **Steps to Reproduce:**
    1.  Set system date to a Monday.
    2.  Ask Roo: "What is the weather forecast for next Tuesday?"
    3.  Observe the date for which the forecast is provided.

**2. Proposed Correction**

*   **Detailed Description:** Modified the core date parsing instruction within the `date_resolution_prompt.txt` to explicitly disambiguate "next [DayOfWeek]" by adding a clarifying phrase that checks if "next [DayOfWeek]" refers to the current week or the following week based on the current day.
*   **Prompt/Instruction Adjustments (if applicable):**
    *   **Old Prompt/Instruction (snippet from `date_resolution_prompt.txt`):**
        ```
        ...If the user mentions a day of the week, assume the closest upcoming instance of that day...
        ```
    *   **New Prompt/Instruction (snippet from `date_resolution_prompt.txt`):**
        ```
        ...If the user mentions a day of the week (e.g., "next Tuesday"):
        - If "today" is before that day of the week in the current week, assume the instance in the current week.
        - If "today" IS that day of the week OR LATER in the current week, assume the instance in the *following* week.
        For example, if today is Monday and the user says "next Tuesday", it means tomorrow. If today is Wednesday and the user says "next Tuesday", it means Tuesday of the *next* week....
        ```
    *   **Reasoning for Change:** The new instruction provides more explicit logic for the LLM to handle "next [DayOfWeek]" queries, reducing ambiguity.

**3. Validation and Testing**

*   **How Fix Was Tested:**
    1.  Manually set system clock to various days of the week (Monday, Wednesday, Saturday).
    2.  Executed a test suite of 20 date-related queries, including "next Tuesday", "next Friday", "this Sunday", "last Monday".
    3.  Verified the agent correctly identified the target date in all test cases.
*   **Test Environment:** Roo Code v0.8.1, Model: `claude-3-opus-20240229`, OS: Windows 11.
*   **Evidence of Fix:**
    *   Log output from test runs showing correct date resolution (attached as `test_run_logs.txt`).
    *   Screenshots of 5 example interactions.

**4. Potential Side Effects or Regressions**

*   Considered potential impact on queries like "this Tuesday" or "Tuesday" (without "next"). Testing indicates these are still handled correctly as they fall under different logic paths or the first clause of the new instruction.
*   A very slight increase in prompt token count for date resolution, but deemed negligible.

**5. Contribution Checklist**

*   [x] I have read and agree to the [Roo Code Contribution Guidelines](LINK_TO_CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md).
*   [ ] My code (if applicable) follows the project's coding standards. (N/A for this prompt fix)
*   [x] I have tested my changes thoroughly.
*   [ ] I have updated relevant documentation (if applicable). (N/A)
