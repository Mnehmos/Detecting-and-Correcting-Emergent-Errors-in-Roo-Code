It provides APIs, SDKs, and tools to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces). It integrates with many popular libraries and frameworks.
    *   URL (main): https://opentelemetry.io/
    *   URL (GitHub): https://github.com/open-telemetry
    *   URL (Spec Issue on Error Reporting): https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/599 (Indicates active discussion on standardizing error reporting within OTel)
*   **Kamon Telemetry (kamon.io):** An open-source tool for Java, Scala, and Kotlin, with built-in support for various frameworks. Allows enriching automatic instrumentation with custom tags.

**Synthesis for Libraries/Frameworks:**
*   OpenTelemetry (OTel) is the dominant open-source standard and framework for telemetry. It's widely adopted and supported.
*   Error reporting is a recognized aspect within the OpenTelemetry community, with ongoing efforts to standardize it.
*   Kamon is an alternative for JVM-based applications but OpenTelemetry seems more broadly applicable for Roo Code.
*   The key will be to leverage OpenTelemetry's existing capabilities and align with its evolving standards for error reporting.
