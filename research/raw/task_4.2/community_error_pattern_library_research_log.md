## 1. Objective
This log documents the research activities undertaken for Task 4.2: Design a framework for a community-contributed error pattern library for Roo Code.

## 2. Memory System Consultation (Initial Step)

**User Instruction:** "Before starting this task, consult the memory system (e.g., memory-agent-sql) for any existing information related to 'community-driven error libraries,' 'pattern sharing platforms for AI,' 'Roo Code error pattern documentation,' or 'verification processes for community contributions.'"

**Actions Taken & Prompts Used (Queries to `memory-agent-sql`):**

1.  **Attempt 1 (Query `memory_entries`):**
    *   Tool: `query_database`
    *   Query: `SELECT * FROM memory_entries WHERE content LIKE '%community-driven error libraries%';`
    *   Result: `Error: SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: memory_entries`

2.  **Attempt 2 (List Tables):**
    *   Tool: `get_table_info`
    *   Arguments: `{}`
    *   Result: Provided a list of available tables, including `memories` and `fts_memory_entries`.

3.  **Attempt 3 (Use `search_memories` tool):**
    *   Tool: `search_memories`
    *   Query: `community-driven error libraries`
    *   Result: `Error: SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: memory_entries` (Indicated tool might be hardcoded to the wrong table).

4.  **Attempt 4 (Query `memories` table, `content` column):**
    *   Tool: `query_database`
    *   Query: `SELECT * FROM memories WHERE content LIKE '%community-driven error libraries%';`
    *   Result: `Error: SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: content`

5.  **Attempt 5 (Get `memories` table schema):**
    *   Tool: `get_table_info`
    *   Arguments: `{"table": "memories"}`
    *   Result: Provided schema for `memories` table, identifying `insight` and `context` as potential text columns.

6.  **Searches on `memories` table (using `insight` and `context` columns):**
    *   Query Term: "community-driven error libraries"
        *   `SELECT * FROM memories WHERE insight LIKE '%community-driven error libraries%';` -> Result: `[]`
        *   `SELECT * FROM memories WHERE context LIKE '%community-driven error libraries%';` -> Result: `[]`
    *   Query Term: "pattern sharing platforms for AI"
        *   `SELECT * FROM memories WHERE insight LIKE '%pattern sharing platforms for AI%';` -> Result: `[]`
        *   `SELECT * FROM memories WHERE context LIKE '%pattern sharing platforms for AI%';` -> Result: `[]`
    *   Query Term: "Roo Code error pattern documentation"
        *   `SELECT * FROM memories WHERE insight LIKE '%Roo Code error pattern documentation%';` -> Result: `[]`
        *   `SELECT * FROM memories WHERE context LIKE '%Roo Code error pattern documentation%';` -> Result: `[]`
    *   Query Term: "verification processes for community contributions"
        *   `SELECT * FROM memories WHERE insight LIKE '%verification processes for community contributions%';` -> Result: `[]`
        *   `SELECT * FROM memories WHERE context LIKE '%verification processes for community contributions%';` -> Result: `[]`

**Conclusion of Memory Consultation:** The memory system (specifically the `memories` table) did not yield any relevant existing information for the specified search terms.

## 3. Research on Community-Contributed Libraries

**Methodology:** Used Brave Search MCP to investigate existing community-driven libraries, knowledge bases, submission/moderation models, especially related to software errors or AI.

**Prompts Used (Brave Search Queries) & Responses Summary:**

1.  **Prompt:** `community-driven software error libraries`
    *   **Response Summary:** Results included articles about specific libraries becoming community-driven after issues (e.g., Slashdot, The Verge on corrupted libraries), general developer resources (daily.dev), lists of community-driven open-source projects (awesomeopensource.com), and tools for error logging (Stack Exchange). OCLC was mentioned as a member-driven library organization. Clarivate and SpringerLink touched on community/collaborative development in library/educational contexts.
    *   **Insight:** General concept of community-driven projects exists, but specific "error libraries" with detailed operational models were not immediately prominent.

2.  **Prompt:** `community knowledge base for software bugs submission moderation`
    *   **Response Summary:** Results pointed to commercial knowledge base software (Forumbee, Gainsight, VisionHelpdesk, KnowledgeBase.com) that often include community forum features with staff moderation. Zendesk discussed differences between knowledge bases and forums. BrowserStack provided guidance on writing bug reports. Sonar mentioned submitting bugs via email to a support team.
    *   **Insight:** Commercial tools offer integrated solutions. Moderation is typically staff-led. Specific community-led *processes* for bug submission/moderation in open platforms were not detailed.

3.  **Prompt:** `open source bug tracker submission moderation process`
    *   **Response Summary:** Results listed various open-source bug tracking tools (Usersnap, Marker.io, Zoho BugTracker, Bugasura, SoftwareTestingMagazine, AccelQ, BrowserStack). A Quora answer briefly mentioned that in open-source communities, issues are tracked, and developers might categorize reported bugs differently (e.g., "works as intended"). ResearchGate had a PDF on a bug tracking system.
    *   **Insight:** Many tools exist, but the detailed community *process* of submission and moderation beyond tool features was not deeply covered in these initial results. The Quora answer hinted at the typical triage/categorization step.

4.  **Prompt:** `AI model behavior sharing platform`
    *   **Response Summary:** Results focused on platforms for sharing AI *models* themselves (ModelShare.ai, Together AI, AIModelShare GitHub), MLOps (Microsoft Azure shared responsibility, arXiv paper on Model Share AI), or AI's influence on brand perception (Jellyfish, ShareOfModel.ai). Microsoft Learn also had pages on sharing AI Builder models within Power Platform.
    *   **Insight:** Existing platforms are more about model deployment/access or MLOps rather than community-driven repositories for *documenting and sharing patterns of AI model behaviors or errors*.

**Overall Research Conclusion:**
While general community-driven platforms, bug trackers, and knowledge bases exist, there isn't a prominent, well-established template specifically for "community-contributed AI error pattern libraries." This highlights an opportunity for Roo Code to establish a novel and valuable resource. The design will draw from best practices in open-source issue tracking, community forums, and knowledge base management.

## 4. Library Design Considerations (Summary)

The detailed design is captured in `research/synthesis/community_error_pattern_library_spec.md`. Key aspects considered include:

### 4.1. Library Structure:
*   Categorization by Roo Code Mode (Code, Architect, Ask, etc.).
*   Tagging system for error types, keywords, and potentially LLMs.
*   A flat structure with robust filtering is preferred for the primary interface.

### 4.2. Submission Process:
*   Channels: GitHub Issues (with a template), dedicated web form, potential future integration within Roo Code.
*   Standardized Format: A YAML-based format was designed to capture comprehensive details (see section 6 and the main spec doc).

### 4.3. Verification and Moderation:
*   Initial automated/moderator-lite triage (completeness, basic duplicate check).
*   Community review (optional but encouraged) for reproducibility and suggestions.
*   Moderator/Maintainer review for final verification (reproducibility, accuracy, clarity, relevance), categorization, and status updates.
*   Actions: Accept, Request More Info, Merge/Link, Reject, Edit/Refine, Deprecate.
*   Contributor recognition.

### 4.4. Access and Search:
*   Dedicated section on the Roo Code documentation website.
*   Search bar and faceted filters (mode, tags, status, etc.).
*   Potential future integration for in-app search from Roo Code.

### 4.5. Integration with Telemetry:
*   Telemetry can identify candidate patterns.
*   Populate frequency data for known patterns.
*   Correlate user reports with anonymous telemetry.
*   Feedback loop for telemetry signatures based on documented solutions.

## 5. Example Error Pattern Entry
An example entry is detailed in `research/synthesis/community_error_pattern_library_spec.md` (Section 6). It demonstrates the proposed standardized format.

## 6. Reflection and Memory Update Plan

**Reflection on Findings:**
*   The initial memory consultation yielded no direct hits, indicating this is a new area of knowledge to be built for the Roo Code project's memory.
*   Existing community platforms are either general (Stack Overflow), tool-focused (bug trackers), or commercially managed knowledge bases.
*   There's a lack of specialized, community-driven libraries for AI error *patterns* specifically, making this a valuable initiative.
*   The design needs to be simple enough for community adoption but structured enough for utility.
*   Moderation and verification are crucial for maintaining quality and trust.

**Plan for Updating Memory System (Post-Task):**
Once this task's outputs are finalized, the following information should be added to the `memories` table (or a more appropriate structured table if available/created by Orchestrator/Memory agent):

1.  **New Insight:** "Designed a framework for a community-contributed error pattern library for Roo Code."
    *   **Category:** `System Design`, `Community Feature`
    *   **Context:** `Task 4.2 output. Details include submission format, verification/moderation process, library structure, access methods, and telemetry integration points.`
    *   **Related To:** `community_error_pattern_library_spec.md`, `error_telemetry_system_spec.md`
    *   **Metadata:** `{"task_id": "4.2", "status": "Completed"}`

2.  **New Insight:** "Proposed standardized YAML format for Roo Code error pattern submissions."
    *   **Category:** `Data Format`, `Community Contribution`
    *   **Context:** `Includes fields for error description, modes affected, example prompt, observed/expected output, cause/analysis, correction strategy, keywords. See community_error_pattern_library_spec.md for full format.`
    *   **Related To:** `community_error_pattern_library_spec.md`
    *   **Metadata:** `{"task_id": "4.2"}`

3.  **New Insight:** "Outlined submission and verification process for community error patterns."
    *   **Category:** `Process Design`, `Community Moderation`
    *   **Context:** `Involves channels like GitHub issues/web forms, initial triage, community review, and final moderator/maintainer verification. Statuses include Reported, Verifying, Accepted, etc. See community_error_pattern_library_spec.md.`
    *   **Related To:** `community_error_pattern_library_spec.md`
    *   **Metadata:** `{"task_id": "4.2"}`

4.  **New Insight:** "Defined structure and access methods for the Roo Code error pattern library."
    *   **Category:** `System Architecture`, `Knowledge Base`
    *   **Context:** `Proposed structure by mode/error type with strong tagging. Access via documentation website with search/filters, and potential future in-app Roo Code integration. See community_error_pattern_library_spec.md.`
    *   **Related To:** `community_error_pattern_library_spec.md`
    *   **Metadata:** `{"task_id": "4.2"}`

These entries will help future tasks or queries understand the design and decisions made for the community error pattern library.
