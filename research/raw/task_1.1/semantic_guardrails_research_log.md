# Mode-Specific Semantic Guardrails Research Log

This document logs the research process and methodologies used to develop the mode-specific semantic guardrails for Roo Code.

## Research Methodology

The research for developing mode-specific semantic guardrails followed a structured approach:

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Examined existing Roo Code documentation
   - Analyzed mode configuration architecture
   - Reviewed error handling mechanisms
   - Explored boomerang task system architecture
   - Identified mode definitions and role specifications

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Decomposed mode behaviors into semantic components
   - Identified potential semantic drift scenarios for each mode
   - Analyzed file permissions and tool restrictions per mode
   - Mapped error propagation points relevant to semantic consistency

3. **Synthesis Phase**
   - Defined baseline semantic behaviors for each mode
   - Developed specific semantic guardrails for each mode
   - Created implementation strategies and pseudocode
   - Generated test cases demonstrating correct vs. drifted outputs

## Key Information Sources

| Source | Path | Key Insights |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Mode Configuration Architecture Analysis | `research/synthesis/mode_configuration_architecture_analysis.md` | Mode loading, system prompt generation, role definition application |
| Error Handling Review | `research/synthesis/existing_error_handling_review.md` | Current validation mechanisms, error types, monitoring integration points |
| Boomerang Task System Analysis | `research/synthesis/boomerang_task_system_analysis.md` | Task delegation, mode switching, state transitions |
| Mode Definitions | `Roo-Code/src/shared/modes.ts` | Role definitions, permissions, custom instructions |

## Mode Analysis Summary

### Code Mode (üíª)
- **Core Role**: Skilled software engineer
- **Permissions**: Full access (read, edit, browser, command, mcp)
- **Semantic Focus**: Implementation quality, code structure, technical precision
- **Drift Risk**: Educational content without implementation, overly abstract responses

### Architect Mode (üèóÔ∏è)
- **Core Role**: Technical leader and planner
- **Permissions**: Limited editing (markdown only), read, browser, mcp
- **Semantic Focus**: Planning, information gathering, structured approaches
- **Drift Risk**: Direct implementation instead of planning

### Ask Mode (‚ùì)
- **Core Role**: Technical assistant and information provider
- **Permissions**: No editing (read, browser, mcp only)
- **Semantic Focus**: Informational responses, explanations, analysis
- **Drift Risk**: Implementation attempts, using unauthorized tools

### Debug Mode (ü™≤)
- **Core Role**: Expert debugger with systematic approach
- **Permissions**: Full access (read, edit, browser, command, mcp)
- **Semantic Focus**: Hypothesis testing, systematic diagnosis
- **Drift Risk**: Missing diagnostic structure, solution without diagnosis

### Orchestrator Mode (ü™É)
- **Core Role**: Workflow coordinator and task delegator
- **Permissions**: None directly (delegates to other modes)
- **Semantic Focus**: Task decomposition, appropriate delegation
- **Drift Risk**: Direct implementation instead of delegation

### Deep Research Mode (üîç)
- **Core Role**: Information discovery and analysis specialist
- **Permissions**: Read, limited editing (likely for research documents)
- **Semantic Focus**: Structured research methodology, analytical frameworks
- **Drift Risk**: Implementation focus instead of research, missing methodology

## Challenge Analysis

The primary challenges identified in semantic drift detection include:

1. **Mode Boundary Ambiguity**: Some tasks might reasonably fall into multiple modes
2. **Inherent Flexibility**: LLMs resist rigid categorization of outputs
3. **Context-Dependent Semantics**: The same output might be appropriate in one context but not another
4. **Natural Task Evolution**: Tasks naturally evolve and might require mode transitions

## Implementation Considerations

Key considerations for implementing the semantic guardrails:

1. **Performance Impact**: Semantic validation adds computational overhead
2. **False Positive Risk**: Overly strict guardrails might flag valid outputs
3. **Integration Complexity**: Validation must integrate with existing error handling
4. **User Experience**: Guardrails should enhance not hinder user experience
5. **Feedback Loop**: System should learn from validation results

## Prompt Experimentation

The following prompts were used to develop test cases:

1. **Code Mode Test**:
   - "Create a function to validate email addresses in JavaScript"
   - Expected: Implementation focus with proper code structure
   - Drift example: Philosophy of validation without code

2. **Architect Mode Test**:
   - "Help me build a REST API for a blog system"
   - Expected: Planning focus with structured approach
   - Drift example: Direct implementation of API code

3. **Ask Mode Test**:
   - "Explain the difference between REST and GraphQL"
   - Expected: Informational response with clear explanation
   - Drift example: Implementation of both API types

4. **Debug Mode Test**:
   - "Debug why my React component isn't re-rendering when props change"
   - Expected: Systematic diagnosis with multiple hypotheses
   - Drift example: Educational content about React rendering

5. **Orchestrator Mode Test**:
   - "Create a web scraper for product data and display it in a dashboard"
   - Expected: Task decomposition and delegation
   - Drift example: Direct implementation of scraper code

6. **Research Mode Test**:
   - "Research the impact of microservices on system reliability"
   - Expected: Structured research with analysis and synthesis
   - Drift example: Implementation guide for microservices

These test cases were designed to represent both semantically correct outputs and clearly drifted outputs for each mode.

## Guardrail Evaluation Methodology

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed guardrails, the following methodology is recommended:

1. **Baseline Establishment**: Collect examples of known good and drifted outputs for each mode
2. **Guardrail Application**: Apply proposed semantic checks to the baseline examples
3. **Metric Collection**: Measure precision, recall, and F1 score for drift detection
4. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust detection thresholds to balance sensitivity
5. **User Impact Assessment**: Evaluate impact on user experience through A/B testing

## Conclusion

The research has established a comprehensive framework for semantic guardrails tailored to each of Roo Code's specialized modes. By defining clear baseline behaviors and specific checks for each mode, this framework provides a foundation for detecting and correcting semantic drift. The implementation recommendations provide a practical roadmap for integrating these guardrails into the existing Roo Code architecture.

The next steps would involve implementing these guardrails in phases, starting with monitoring and gradually moving toward automated correction as confidence in the detection mechanisms increases.
