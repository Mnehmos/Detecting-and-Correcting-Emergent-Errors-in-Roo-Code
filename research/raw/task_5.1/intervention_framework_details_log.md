## Objective
This document logs the detailed elements considered during the development of the Strategic Intervention Points Framework for Roo Code. It includes identified interaction points, developed decision criteria, and considered effectiveness metrics, as required by Task 5.1.

## 1. Identified Roo Code User Interaction Points & Potential Intervention Opportunities

This section expands on the general interaction points identified during web research, considering them as potential junctures for human verification or input within Roo Code workflows.

### Existing Interaction Points (from research & prior task knowledge):
1.  **Task Initiation:**
    *   **Description:** User defines the initial goal or problem.
    *   **Potential Intervention:** Verify understanding of complex/ambiguous tasks before proceeding. Suggest breaking down very large tasks.
2.  **Mode Selection/Configuration (Task 0.2):**
    *   **Description:** User chooses or customizes an operational mode for Roo.
    *   **Potential Intervention:** If a task seems misaligned with a selected mode's capabilities, or if a highly restrictive/permissive mode is chosen for a sensitive task, prompt for confirmation.
3.  **Boomerang Task System (Task 0.1):**
    *   **Description:** Sub-tasks or significant operational phases complete and "return" to an orchestrator or user.
    *   **Potential Intervention:** These are natural checkpoints. Verify outputs of critical sub-tasks, especially if they are foundational for subsequent steps.
4.  **Tool Use Approval/Execution:**
    *   **Description:** Roo requests to use a tool (e.g., `execute_command`, `apply_diff`, `write_to_file`).
    *   **Potential Intervention:** Already an explicit user approval step. Enhance by providing more context on *why* a tool is being used if the action is high-risk or unusual for the task type.
5.  **`ask_followup_question` Tool:**
    *   **Description:** Roo explicitly requests clarification.
    *   **Potential Intervention:** This is a direct human interaction. Ensure questions are clear and targeted. Could be triggered proactively by Roo if confidence is low.
6.  **Checkpoint Creation (File Ops, Command Exec):**
    *   **Description:** Automatic checkpoints before potentially significant changes.
    *   **Potential Intervention:** Notify user of significant checkpoints, especially if multiple high-impact operations are queued. Offer an immediate review option before proceeding with a batch of changes.
7.  **Custom Instruction Application:**
    *   **Description:** User-defined instructions guiding Roo's behavior.
    *   **Potential Intervention:** If a custom instruction seems to conflict strongly with a task goal or safety protocols, flag for user review.
8.  **Error Detection System Outputs (Phases 1, 2, 3):**
    *   **Semantic Drift Flags (Task 1.1, 1.2):** Roo's understanding or output deviates.
        *   **Potential Intervention:** Halt and request human clarification/correction.
    *   **Task Boundary Violations (Task 2.1):** Roo attempts actions outside defined scope.
        *   **Potential Intervention:** Block action and notify user, requesting re-scoping or confirmation to override.
    *   **High-Cost Anomalies (Task 2.2):** Unexpectedly high resource use (tokens, time).
        *   **Potential Intervention:** Pause task, inform user of projected cost/time, request confirmation to proceed.
    *   **Sandbox Mode Deviations (Task 2.3):** Actions in sandbox differ from expected.
        *   **Potential Intervention:** If sandbox test fails or shows risky behavior, require human review before attempting in live environment.
    *   **Auto-Approval Flags (Task 3.1):** Situations where auto-approval might be risky.
        *   **Potential Intervention:** Switch from auto-approval to manual verification for flagged items.
9.  **LLM Output Ambiguity/Low Confidence:**
    *   **Description:** The LLM itself indicates low confidence in its response or generation.
    *   **Potential Intervention:** Proactively solicit human review or ask for more specific instructions.
10. **Completion of Major Task Phases / Before Final `attempt_completion`:**
    *   **Description:** Before Roo considers the entire task complete.
    *   **Potential Intervention:** Offer a summary of actions taken and key results for a final human "go/no-go" or request for revisions.

## 2. Detailed Decision Criteria for Requesting Human Input

This section details the factors influencing the decision to trigger human intervention.

1.  **Risk/Impact Level:**
    *   **Criteria:** Criticality of the system/file being modified, potential for data loss, security implications, cost of error.
    *   **Trigger:** High-risk operations (e.g., modifying core production files, deleting data, executing commands with broad permissions) always require explicit confirmation, potentially with a "cooling-off" period or second confirmation.
2.  **Confidence Score (from LLM or internal checks):**
    *   **Criteria:** LLM-provided confidence, internal consistency checks, semantic similarity to request.
    *   **Trigger:** Below a user-configurable (or dynamically adjusted) threshold, prompt for verification. For very low scores, halt and request explicit guidance.
3.  **Novelty/Complexity of Task/Sub-task:**
    *   **Criteria:** Task pattern not seen before, involves multiple complex steps, requires synthesizing information from many disparate sources.
    *   **Trigger:** For novel or highly complex tasks, insert verification steps after key milestones or before committing to a complex plan.
4.  **Ambiguity Level (in request or Roo's understanding):**
    *   **Criteria:** Detected ambiguity in user prompt, conflicting instructions, multiple interpretations of a goal.
    *   **Trigger:** Use `ask_followup_question` proactively. Present interpretations and ask user to select/clarify.
5.  **Error Detection System Flags:**
    *   **Criteria:** Any active flag from systems designed in Phases 1-3 (semantic drift, boundary violation, cost anomaly, auto-approval override).
    *   **Trigger:** Specific intervention based on the flag type (e.g., halt for boundary violation, request confirmation for cost anomaly).
6.  **User Configuration/Preferences:**
    *   **Criteria:** User-defined settings for oversight levels (e.g., "paranoid mode" vs. "trusting mode"), specific files/directories requiring mandatory review.
    *   **Trigger:** Adhere to user preferences. Allow users to define "always ask for X" or "never ask for Y (if low risk)".
7.  **Irreversibility of Action:**
    *   **Criteria:** Actions that are difficult or impossible to undo (e.g., permanent deletion, external API calls with side effects).
    *   **Trigger:** Always require explicit confirmation, possibly with a warning about irreversibility.
8.  **Cumulative Change Magnitude:**
    *   **Criteria:** Number of files changed, lines of code added/deleted/modified in a single operational block.
    *   **Trigger:** If changes exceed a certain threshold since last human interaction, prompt for a review and checkpoint.
9.  **Deviation from Established Patterns/Best Practices:**
    *   **Criteria:** Generated code or actions deviate significantly from known good patterns, project conventions, or security best practices.
    *   **Trigger:** Flag the deviation and ask for human confirmation, explaining the potential concern.
10. **Resource Consumption Thresholds:**
    *   **Criteria:** Predicted or actual token usage, execution time, API call quotas approaching limits.
    *   **Trigger:** Inform user and ask for confirmation before proceeding if thresholds are likely to be breached.

## 3. Considerations for Effectiveness Metrics

Measuring the success of human intervention strategies.

1.  **Error Reduction Rate:**
    *   **Metric:** Percentage decrease in errors reaching downstream stages or production after implementing intervention points, compared to a baseline.
    *   **Measurement:** Track error telemetry (Task 4.1) before and after.
2.  **User Satisfaction:**
    *   **Metric:** Qualitative feedback (surveys, interviews) and quantitative ratings (e.g., on a Likert scale) regarding the helpfulness, intrusiveness, and clarity of interventions.
    *   **Measurement:** Periodic user surveys, feedback forms after intervention events.
3.  **Task Completion Time (Human + AI):**
    *   **Metric:** Total time to complete tasks with interventions vs. fully automated (or less intervened) workflows.
    *   **Measurement:** Log task start/end times, and time spent by humans in verification steps.
4.  **Verification Effort vs. Rework Avoided:**
    *   **Metric:** Time/cost spent by humans on verification vs. estimated time/cost of fixing errors that would have occurred without intervention.
    *   **Measurement:** Estimate rework time based on historical data for similar errors.
5.  **Intervention Acceptance Rate:**
    *   **Metric:** Percentage of times users agree with Roo's suggestion when an intervention is triggered (e.g., confirming a risky action, accepting a clarification).
    *   **Measurement:** Log user responses to intervention prompts.
6.  **False Positive Rate of Interventions:**
    *   **Metric:** Percentage of interventions triggered where the AI's proposed action was actually correct and would not have led to an error.
    *   **Measurement:** Requires human judgment post-intervention or analysis of logs where users overrode an intervention.
7.  **User Trust Over Time:**
    *   **Metric:** Changes in user-settable autonomy levels (if available), or qualitative feedback on trust.
    *   **Measurement:** Track changes in user preferences, survey responses related to trust.
8.  **Cognitive Load on User:**
    *   **Metric:** Perceived mental effort required by the user to handle interventions.
    *   **Measurement:** NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) or similar subjective workload assessments.
9.  **Frequency and Intrusiveness of Interventions:**
    *   **Metric:** Number of interventions per task or per hour. User perception of how disruptive the interventions are.
    *   **Measurement:** Log intervention events. Qualitative feedback.
10. **Learning Curve / Adaptation Time:**
    *   **Metric:** How quickly users adapt to and effectively use the intervention mechanisms.
    *   **Measurement:** Track efficiency and error rates of new users over time.
