## Objective
This document logs the search queries used and summarizes the results obtained during the research phase of Task 5.1: Strategic Intervention Points.

## Search Log

### Search 1: "human-in-the-loop AI"
- **Query:** `human-in-the-loop AI`
- **Tool Used:** brave-search
- **Summary of Results:** Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) AI involves humans playing an interactive and iterative role in a model's development and operation. This includes data curation, annotation, model training, validation, and refining outputs. The goal is to combine human intelligence with AI capabilities, especially for tasks requiring judgment, nuance, or correction of AI errors. Humans are directly involved in the decision loop to control or change the outcome of a process.

### Search 2: "strategic intervention points in AI agent workflows"
- **Query:** `strategic intervention points in AI agent workflows`
- **Tool Used:** brave-search
- **Summary of Results:** Agentic AI workflows aim for minimal human intervention but recognize its necessity. Strategic intervention points are identified by analyzing the context, evaluating multiple options, and creating action plans based on real-time conditions. Identifying business pain points and areas where AI might struggle (e.g., complex reasoning, high-stakes decisions) helps determine where human oversight can deliver the most value and mitigate risks. The integration should be seamless and enhance, not hinder, the workflow.

### Search 3: "Roo Code user interaction points"
- **Query:** `Roo Code user interaction points`
- **Tool Used:** brave-search
- **Summary of Results:** Based on Roo Code documentation and community discussions, key user interaction points include:
    - Task initiation and definition.
    - Mode selection and customization.
    - Boomerang Task system (implying review/action points upon task segment completion).
    - Checkpoints created before significant actions (file operations, command execution), allowing rollback.
    - Explicit requests for information via `ask_followup_question` tool.
    - Use of Custom Instructions to guide AI behavior.
    - Interactions via browser automation features.
    - General interaction with the AI through the chat interface.

### Search 4: "decision frameworks for human verification in AI"
- **Query:** `decision frameworks for human verification in AI`
- **Tool Used:** brave-search
- **Summary of Results:** Decision frameworks for human verification in AI emphasize:
    - **Risk Assessment and Ethical Review:** Crucial for AI governance, especially in high-stakes domains.
    - **Task-Specific Knowledge:** Verification is most effective when the human verifier possesses relevant expertise.
    - **Clearly Defined Exceptions for Autonomy:** Human decision-making should often be the default, with AI augmenting it. Exceptions where AI operates autonomously need clear definitions.
    - **Handling Intangible Human Factors:** AI often fails to capture ethical, moral, and nuanced human considerations, necessitating human oversight.
    - **Verification & Validation (V&V) Frameworks:** These exist for ML systems and stress the importance of well-defined tasks, robust systems, representative data, and the ability to handle novel situations.
    - **Transparency, Monitoring, and Oversight:** These are fundamental for trustworthy AI-enabled decision support.
    - **Confidence Scores:** Low confidence from an AI model can be a trigger for human review.
    - **Impact of Decision:** Higher potential impact or irreversibility of an AI's action warrants human verification.
    - **Novelty/Complexity:** Tasks that are novel or highly complex are good candidates for human oversight.
