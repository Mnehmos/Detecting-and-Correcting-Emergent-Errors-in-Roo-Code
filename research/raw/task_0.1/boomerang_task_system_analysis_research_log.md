# Boomerang Task System Analysis - Research Log

## Research Methodology

This log documents the systematic process I followed to analyze the Boomerang task system in Roo Code. The research involved:

1. **Repository Exploration**: Initial exploration of the Roo-Code repository structure to identify key components
2. **Code Analysis**: Detailed code review of relevant files to understand implementation
3. **System Mapping**: Mapping the relationships between components to understand task flow
4. **Error Propagation Analysis**: Identification of potential error propagation points

## Research Activities

### 1. Repository Cloning
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code.git
```
- Successfully cloned the repository to analyze the implementation details

### 2. Memory System Check
- Checked for existing information about the Boomerang task system in the memory database
- No prior information was found, indicating this is the first analysis of this system

### 3. Repository Structure Analysis
- Examined the high-level directory structure
- Found key project files that might contain relevant information
- Identified `.roomodes` file as a potential source for mode definitions

### 4. Relevant File Identification
Using targeted search queries to identify files related to the Boomerang task system:
```bash
search_files path="Roo-Code" regex="boomerang" file_pattern="*.ts"
search_files path="Roo-Code" regex="task.*system|task.*delegation" file_pattern="*.ts"
search_files path="Roo-Code" regex="orchestrator|task.*management" file_pattern="*.ts"
```

The key files identified were:
- `Roo-Code/src/shared/modes.ts` - Contains mode definitions, including the orchestrator mode
- `Roo-Code/src/core/tools/newTaskTool.ts` - Implementation of the new_task tool
- `Roo-Code/src/core/task/Task.ts` - Core task implementation
- `Roo-Code/src/core/prompts/tools/new-task.ts` - Description of the new_task tool

### 5. Detailed Code Analysis

#### 5.1 Mode Definitions
Examined `src/shared/modes.ts` to understand mode definitions, particularly the orchestrator mode's role in task delegation:

Key findings:
- The orchestrator mode is designed to "coordinate complex workflows by delegating tasks to specialized modes"
- It breaks down complex tasks into logical subtasks
- It uses the `new_task` tool to delegate tasks to appropriate specialized modes
- It tracks and manages the progress of all subtasks

#### 5.2 Task Implementation
Analyzed `src/core/task/Task.ts` to understand the core task implementation:

Key findings:
- Tasks can have parent-child relationships (rootTask, parentTask properties)
- Tasks can be paused when a subtask is created and resumed when the subtask completes
- The `isPaused` flag is used to indicate that a task is waiting for a subtask to complete
- The `pausedModeSlug` property stores the mode to switch back to when resuming
- The `resumePausedTask` method is used to resume a paused task after a subtask completes
- The `waitForResume` method is used by a paused task to wait for a subtask to complete

#### 5.3 New Task Tool Implementation
Examined `src/core/tools/newTaskTool.ts` to understand how new tasks are created:

Key findings:
- The tool validates that the requested mode exists
- It preserves the current mode to resume with it later
- It switches to the requested mode before creating the new task
- The parent task is paused (`isPaused = true`) while the subtask runs
- A "taskSpawned" event is emitted with the new task's ID
- A "taskPaused" event is emitted when the parent task is paused

#### 5.4 New Task Tool Description
Analyzed `src/core/prompts/tools/new-task.ts` to understand how the tool is described to users:

Key findings:
- The tool takes two parameters: `mode` (the mode for the new task) and `message` (instructions for the new task)
- It creates a new task instance in the specified mode with the provided message

### 6. Project-Specific Files Analysis
Examined project-specific files to understand the context of this research:

- `.roo/boomerang-state.json` - Currently empty, but designated to track task statuses
- `.roo/project-metadata.json` - Contains project metadata
- `README.md` - Provides overview of the research project
- `.roo/logs/orchestrator/decisions.md` - Logs orchestrator decisions

## Code Paths Examined

1. **Task Creation**: 
   - `newTaskTool` function in `src/core/tools/newTaskTool.ts` (lines 8-97)
   - Particularly the initialization at lines 81-82:
   ```typescript
   const newCline = await provider.initClineWithTask(message, undefined, cline)
   cline.emit("taskSpawned", newCline.taskId)
   ```

2. **Task Pausing**:
   - Lines 87-89 in `src/core/tools/newTaskTool.ts`:
   ```typescript
   cline.isPaused = true
   cline.emit("taskPaused")
   ```

3. **Task Resumption**:
   - `resumePausedTask` method in `src/core/task/Task.ts` (lines 608-630)
   - Particularly the communication between parent-child tasks at lines 619-622:
   ```typescript
   await this.addToApiConversationHistory({
       role: "user",
       content: [{ type: "text", text: `[new_task completed] Result: ${lastMessage}` }],
   })
   ```

4. **Task Waiting**:
   - `waitForResume` method in `src/core/task/Task.ts` (lines 906-916)
   - Uses an interval to check if `isPaused` is false

5. **Mode Switching**:
   - Lines 72-76 in `src/core/tools/newTaskTool.ts`:
   ```typescript
   cline.pausedModeSlug = (await provider.getState()).mode ?? defaultModeSlug
   await provider.handleModeSwitch(mode)
   ```
   - Lines 1000-1012 in `src/core/task/Task.ts` for switching back when resuming

## Key Findings

1. The Boomerang task system is implemented through a combination of:
   - The `new_task` tool for task delegation
   - The `Task` class for task management
   - Events for communication between tasks
   - Mode switching for specialized handling

2. Tasks are delegated with a clear parent-child relationship:
   - Parent tasks are paused when they delegate a subtask
   - Parent tasks resume when the subtask completes
   - Task results are communicated back to the parent task

3. Several potential error propagation points were identified:
   - Task pausing and resuming mechanisms
   - Mode switching during task delegation
   - Communication of results between tasks
   - Error handling in the task execution flow

This raw research data forms the foundation for the comprehensive technical documentation on the Boomerang task system.
