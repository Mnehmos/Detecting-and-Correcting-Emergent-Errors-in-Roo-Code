# Task Boundary Enforcement Research Log

## Objective
This log documents the research process for Task 2.1: Task Boundary Enforcement, focusing on identifying current task boundaries, researching stricter mechanisms, and designing verification hooks for Roo Code's Boomerang system.

## Phase 1: Initial Memory Consultation

**Goal:** Check for existing knowledge in the memory system.

**Prompts used with `memory-agent-sql` -> `search_memories`:**
1.  `"task boundary enforcement"`
2.  `"error propagation prevention in Boomerang"`
3.  `"Roo Code task isolation"`
4.  `"verification hooks for task completion"`

**Results:** No relevant information found for any of the queries.

## Phase 2: Researching Strict Boundary Mechanisms

### 2.1 Data Validation and Sanitization

**Goal:** Investigate data validation and sanitization techniques applicable to inter-task communication.

**Prompt used with `brave-search` -> `brave_web_search`:**
`"data validation and sanitization for inter-process communication"`

**Key Findings:**
- Data validation ensures input data meets predefined criteria (type, range, format).
- Data sanitization cleans/transforms input to remove/neutralize harmful elements.
- Both are crucial for data integrity between tasks.

### 2.2 Immutable Task Contexts and Copy-on-Write

**Goal:** Explore immutability and copy-on-write for preventing unintended data modification.

**Prompt used with `brave-search` -> `brave_web_search`:**
`"immutable task contexts OR copy-on-write for task data"`

**Key Findings:**
- Immutability prevents object state changes after creation, forcing new instances for modifications.
- Copy-on-Write (COW) duplicates shared resources only upon modification attempts.
- Both can prevent tasks from corrupting shared state/data.

### 2.3 Resource Sandboxing and Limits

**Goal:** Understand how to control resource access and consumption for child tasks.

**Prompt used with `brave-search` -> `brave_web_search`:**
`"resource sandboxing for child processes OR task resource limits"`

**Key Findings:**
- Process sandboxing restricts a process's environment and access to system resources.
- Resource limits (e.g., CPU, memory) control consumption by a process.
- Both can prevent misbehaving child tasks from impacting the parent or system.

### 2.4 Clearer Contracts/Schemas for Task Inputs/Outputs

**Goal:** Investigate the use of schemas and contracts for task data exchange.

**Prompt used with `brave-search` -> `brave_web_search`:**
`"schema validation for task inputs outputs OR API contract testing"`

**Key Findings:**
- API contracts define expected input/output formats between components.
- Schema validation checks data conformance to these contracts (e.g., using JSON Schema).
- Contract testing verifies adherence to these contracts.
- This makes task interactions predictable and robust.
