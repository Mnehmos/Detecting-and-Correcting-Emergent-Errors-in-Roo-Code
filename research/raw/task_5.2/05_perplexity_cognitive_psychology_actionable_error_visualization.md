**Cognitive Psychology Principles for Actionable Error Visualization**

Effective error visualization, particularly in the context of uncertainty, relies on several cognitive psychology principles:

1.  **Cognitive Load and Working Memory Demand**:
    *   Errors often occur when visualizations require complex mental computations, increasing cognitive load and working memory demand[1][3].
    *   Simplifying visualizations can reduce errors by minimizing cognitive effort.

2.  **Mental Schema and Cognitive Transformations**:
    *   Visualizations that do not match users' learned graphic conventions (mental schema) require additional cognitive transformations, which can increase errors and processing time[3].
    *   Aligning visualizations with users' mental schema enhances comprehension and reduces misinterpretation.

3.  **Heuristics and Biases**:
    *   Heuristics can lead to accurate judgments but may also introduce biases, especially in non-optimal visualization formats (e.g., error bars)[5].
    *   Understanding these biases is crucial for designing effective error visualizations.

4.  **Design Principles for Visualizations**:
    *   Effective visualizations should automate the distinction between essential and irrelevant information and present data in a way that aligns with cognitive design principles[4].
    *   This alignment helps ensure that visualizations are intuitive and easy to understand, reducing errors.

By applying these principles, error visualizations can be designed to be more actionable and effective.
