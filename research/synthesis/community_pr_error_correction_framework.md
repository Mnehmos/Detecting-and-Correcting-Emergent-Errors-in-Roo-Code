## Objective
This document outlines a framework for community-contributed error corrections to Roo Code via GitHub Pull Requests (PRs). It includes PR templates, contribution guidelines, a review and integration process, and recommendations for fostering community contributions. This framework aims to leverage the community's expertise to improve Roo Code, aligning with the project's "for the community and by the community" ethos.

## 1. Research Summary: Community Contribution Models & Best Practices

Our research into successful open-source projects, particularly those involving AI/ML, highlighted several key best practices for managing community contributions:

*   **Clear and Accessible Guidelines:** Comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md` files are crucial. These should cover setup, coding standards (even for non-code contributions like prompt adjustments), testing expectations, and the PR lifecycle.
*   **Standardized Templates:** Issue and PR templates streamline the submission process, ensuring contributors provide necessary information. For error corrections, this includes linking to existing issues or error patterns.
*   **Welcoming and Responsive Communication:** A positive and helpful community environment encourages contributions. Maintainers should be responsive to questions and PRs.
*   **Structured Review Process:** A well-defined review process with clear roles (maintainers, community reviewers), automated checks (linting, basic tests), and explicit acceptance criteria is essential.
*   **Iterative Feedback:** Provide constructive feedback and allow contributors to iterate on their PRs.
*   **Recognition and Appreciation:** Acknowledge and thank contributors for their efforts.
*   **Gradual Onboarding:** For AI/ML projects, where fixes might involve nuanced understanding of model behavior, consider pathways for contributors to start with smaller, well-defined tasks before tackling more complex error corrections.
*   **Focus on Reproducibility:** For error reports and fixes, clear steps to reproduce the error and verify the fix are paramount.

## 2. Proposed Pull Request (PR) Templates for Error Corrections

To ensure consistency and completeness, the following PR templates are proposed. These should be stored in the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directory of the Roo Code repository.

### Contributing Error Corrections to Roo Code

We welcome contributions from the community to help us improve Roo Code! If you've found an error and have a fix, here's how you can contribute:

**A. Before You Start**

1.  **Check Existing Issues & PRs:** Search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code/pulls) to see if the error has already been reported or if a fix is in progress.
2.  **Understand the Error:** If possible, try to understand the root cause of the error. Referencing the [Community Error Pattern Library](LINK_TO_ERROR_PATTERN_LIBRARY_SPEC.md) might be helpful.
3.  **Keep it Focused:** Each Pull Request should address a single error or a closely related set of errors.

**B. Creating Your Pull Request (PR)**

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork the `RooVetGit/Roo-Code` repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your fork for your fix. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/incorrect-response-parsing`, `patch/readme-typo`).
3.  **Make Your Changes:**
    *   **Code Fixes:** If your fix involves code changes (e.g., Python, TypeScript), please adhere to the existing coding style and conventions in the codebase.
    *   **Prompt/Instruction Fixes:** For errors related to AI agent behavior, your fix might involve adjusting prompts, instructions, or configurations. Clearly document the "before" and "after" and the reasoning for your change.
    *   **Configuration Fixes:** Changes to configuration files should be clearly explained.
4.  **Test Your Changes:**
    *   Thoroughly test your fix to ensure it resolves the error without introducing new problems.
    *   Document your testing process and results in the PR description.
    *   Consider edge cases and potential side effects.
5.  **Update Documentation (if applicable):** If your fix affects user-facing behavior, documentation, or requires changes to existing documentation, please include those updates in your PR.
6.  **Use the Correct PR Template:** When submitting your PR, choose the appropriate template (`Bug Fix` or `Trivial Fix`). Fill out all sections of the template as completely as possible.
7.  **Write Clear Commit Messages:** Follow standard practices for writing clear and informative commit messages.

**C. The Review Process**

1.  **Initial Review:** A maintainer or community reviewer will review your PR. They may ask questions or request changes.
2.  **Automated Checks:** Your PR may be subject to automated checks (e.g., linting, basic tests). Ensure these checks pass.
3.  **Feedback and Iteration:** Be responsive to feedback. You may need to make changes to your PR based on the review.
4.  **Approval and Merge:** Once the PR is approved and all checks pass, a maintainer will merge it into the main codebase.
5.  **Timeline:** We aim to review PRs within [e.g., 3-5 business days], but this can vary depending on the complexity and volume of contributions.

**D. Coding Standards (General)**

*   While many error corrections might not involve traditional coding, if you are modifying scripts or internal logic:
    *   Follow the existing code style of the file you are editing.
    *   Write clear, concise, and well-commented code where necessary.
    *   Ensure your changes are easy to understand.

**E. Getting Help**

If you have questions or need clarification, feel free to:
*   Comment on the relevant GitHub Issue.

## 4. Proposed Review and Integration Process

This process outlines the steps from PR submission to integration for community-contributed error corrections.

**Phase 1: Submission & Initial Triage**

1.  **Contributor Submits PR:** The contributor uses the appropriate PR template.
2.  **Automated Checks Triggered:**
    *   **Linting:** Code style checks (if applicable).
    *   **Basic Sanity Tests:** A minimal set of automated tests to catch obvious breakages.
    *   **CLA Check (if implemented):** Ensure contributor has signed a Contributor License Agreement if required by the project.
3.  **Labeling:** Bots or maintainers apply initial labels (e.g., `needs-review`, `bug`, `community-pr`, `area/specific-module`).
4.  **Maintainer Triage (Daily/Regularly):**
    *   Quickly assess the PR for completeness (template filled, clear description).
    *   Assign a primary reviewer (maintainer or experienced community member).
    *   If the PR is clearly off-topic, spam, or malicious, close it with an explanation.

**Phase 2: Review**

1.  **Primary Reviewer Assigned:**
    *   **Maintainer:** Can directly review and approve.
    *   **Community Reviewer:** An experienced community member can review and provide feedback, but a maintainer's approval is still required for merging.
2.  **Review Criteria:**
    *   **Clarity of Problem:** Is the error clearly described and reproducible?
    *   **Effectiveness of Fix:** Does the proposed solution actually fix the error?
    *   **Testing & Validation:** Is there sufficient evidence that the fix works and has been tested?
    *   **Code Quality (if applicable):** Does the code (or prompt/config change) adhere to project standards? Is it clear and maintainable?
    *   **Impact Analysis:** Are potential side effects or regressions considered?
    *   **Documentation:** Is documentation updated if necessary?
    *   **Scope:** Is the PR focused on a single fix?
3.  **Feedback & Iteration:**
    *   Reviewers provide constructive feedback using GitHub's review tools (comments, suggestions).
    *   The contributor addresses feedback and updates the PR. This may involve multiple iterations.
    *   Maintain open and respectful communication.

**Phase 3: Approval & Merge**

1.  **Reviewer(s) Approve:** At least one maintainer (or a designated number of reviewers including at least one maintainer) approves the changes.
2.  **Final Checks:**
    *   All automated checks must be passing.
    *   All review comments resolved or addressed.
3.  **Maintainer Merges PR:**
    *   Typically using a "squash and merge" or "rebase and merge" strategy to keep the main branch history clean. The choice depends on project policy.
    *   Ensure the commit message is informative and references the original issue/PR.
4.  **Post-Merge:**
    *   The contributor is thanked.
    *   The related issue (if any) is closed.
    *   The change is included in the next release notes.

**Roles:**

*   **Contributors:** Community members who submit PRs.
*   **Community Reviewers (Optional but Recommended):** Experienced community members who can help with the review load and provide diverse perspectives. They cannot merge PRs.
*   **Maintainers:** Core team members with merge access. Responsible for final approval and integration.

**Handling Feedback and Revisions:**

*   Use GitHub's review features for inline comments and suggestions.
*   Encourage contributors to ask for clarification if feedback is unclear.
*   If a PR becomes stale or the contributor is unresponsive after a reasonable time, a maintainer may take over the PR, close it, or ask if another community member wants to pick it up.

## 5. Recommendations for Fostering Community Contributions

1.  **Actively Promote Contribution Opportunities:**
    *   Clearly label issues that are good for new contributors (e.g., `good first issue`, `help wanted`).
    *   Highlight community contributions in project updates, newsletters, or social media.
2.  **Provide Excellent Documentation:**
    *   Ensure `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and other documentation are up-to-date, clear, and easy to find.
    *   Include a guide on setting up the development environment.
3.  **Be Responsive and Welcoming:**
    *   Acknowledge new PRs and issues promptly.
    *   Thank contributors for their efforts, even if the PR isn't merged.
    *   Foster a positive and inclusive community atmosphere.
4.  **Establish a Mentorship Program (Optional):** Pair experienced community members or maintainers with new contributors to guide them through their first few PRs.
5.  **Recognize Contributors:**
    *   Maintain a list of contributors.
    *   Offer virtual badges or acknowledgments.
6.  **Streamline the Process:**
    *   Continuously evaluate and refine the contribution process to remove friction.
    *   Use bots for automation where appropriate (e.g., labeling, CLA checks, reminders).
7.  **Clear Communication Channels:** Provide clear channels for discussion (e.g., GitHub Discussions, Discord server, forum).
8.  **Start Small:** Encourage new contributors to start with smaller, well-defined fixes (e.g., documentation typos, minor bug fixes) to build confidence and familiarity with the process.

By implementing this framework, Roo Code can effectively harness the collective intelligence and effort of its community to identify and correct errors, leading to a more robust and reliable platform.
