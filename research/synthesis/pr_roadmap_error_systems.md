The roadmap is structured to deliver foundational capabilities first, followed by increasingly sophisticated features, ensuring an iterative and manageable development process.

**Roo Code Repository:** `https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code`

## 2. Prioritization Rationale & Phasing Strategy

The PR roadmap is structured into logical phases to ensure a manageable and incremental implementation.

**Prioritization Factors Considered:**
1.  **Foundational Nature:** Components that are prerequisites for other features or establish core infrastructure.
2.  **Impact on Stability & Safety:** Features that directly address critical error handling, safety, or system robustness.
3.  **User-Facing Value:** Features that provide immediate and tangible benefits to the user experience.
4.  **Feasibility & Complexity:** Balancing early wins with more complex undertakings.
5.  **Logical Dependencies:** Ensuring that PRs are sequenced according to their technical dependencies.
6.  **Alignment with Core Project Goals:** Prioritizing features central to error detection, correction, and prevention.

**Complexity Estimates:**
*   **Small:** Focused change, typically affecting 1-2 files or a small module.
*   **Medium:** Involves multiple components, a new small module, or significant changes to an existing module.
*   **Large:** Represents a significant new system, major refactoring, or complex integrations.

## 3. Phase A: Core Infrastructure & Foundational Safety

This phase focuses on establishing essential error handling improvements, basic telemetry, the PR contribution framework, core structures for conditional auto-approval, task boundary enforcement, and the initial definition of the sandbox mode.

### PR-A.1: Enhance Core Error Handling Mechanisms
*   **Description:** Implement immediate improvements to Roo Code's error handling based on `existing_error_handling_review.md`. This includes adding timeout mechanisms (especially for `waitForResume`), enhancing state validation in task transitions, and standardizing error propagation.
*   **Source Research:** `research/synthesis/existing_error_handling_review.md`, `research/synthesis/boomerang_task_system_analysis.md`
*   **Conceptual Changes:**
    *   Modify `Task.ts` to include timeouts for `waitForResume`.
    *   Add explicit state validation checks before and after key transitions in `Task.ts` and `newTaskTool.ts`.
    *   Define and implement clearer rules for error propagation versus local handling.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Timeout mechanisms prevent indefinite hangs in task waiting states.
    *   State validation logs inconsistencies and potentially prevents invalid transitions.
    *   Error propagation follows newly defined, consistent rules.
*   **Dependencies:** None
*   **Complexity:** Medium

### PR-A.2: Implement Basic Error Telemetry System
*   **Description:** Set up the foundational infrastructure for the privacy-respecting error telemetry system, including opt-in mechanisms, basic data collection for unhandled exceptions, anonymization, and secure transmission.
*   **Source Research:** `research/synthesis/error_telemetry_system_spec.md`
*   **Conceptual Changes:**
    *   Implement UI for telemetry opt-in/opt-out.
    *   Develop core logic for collecting, anonymizing (stripping PII, generalizing paths), and formatting basic error data (error type, anonymized stack trace, Roo version, OS).
    *   Set up a secure endpoint for receiving telemetry data (initially, this could be a simple logging service or a placeholder).
    *   Integrate with existing `TelemetryClient` if suitable, or create a new lightweight telemetry submission service.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Users can opt-in/out of telemetry.
    *   Basic, anonymized error reports for unhandled exceptions are generated and can be transmitted.
    *   Privacy principles (data minimization, anonymization) are adhered to.
*   **Dependencies:** None
*   **Complexity:** Medium

### PR-A.3: Establish Community PR Contribution Framework

    *   Integrate a basic hook point in the action execution lifecycle (e.g., before tool use) to call the CAA service.
    *   Initial decision logic: default to manual approval or respect existing global toggles.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   CAA service structure is in place.
    *   The system can be called before an action, even if it defaults to existing approval logic.
    *   Basic logging of CAA invocation.

    *   Update `DecisionEngine` logic to factor in these new signals (e.g., if a guardrail flags an error, increase likelihood of manual review).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   CAA decisions are influenced by outputs from semantic guardrails and consistency checks.
    *   Actions with detected semantic issues are more likely to require manual review.
