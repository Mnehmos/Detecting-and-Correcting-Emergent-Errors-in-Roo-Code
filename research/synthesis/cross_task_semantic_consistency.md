# Implementation Specification for Cross-Task Semantic Consistency Checks

## 0. Executive Summary

This document details proposed methods, metrics, and an implementation plan for verifying semantic consistency between parent tasks and their child tasks within Roo Code's Boomerang system. The goal is to detect and mitigate semantic drift at task boundaries, ensuring that child task outputs align with the parent task's original intent, thereby maintaining overall workflow coherence and preventing error propagation.

## 1. Introduction

Semantic consistency between parent and child tasks is crucial for the effective functioning of a hierarchical task delegation system like Roo Code's Boomerang. While mode-specific semantic guardrails (Task 1.1) ensure a child task's output is valid for its operational mode, cross-task consistency checks verify that the child's output is also semantically aligned with the specific instructions and objectives delegated by the parent task. This prevents scenarios where a child task might perform its function correctly in isolation but fail to meet the parent's actual requirements, leading to "semantic drift" across task boundaries.

This specification covers:
- Analysis of how task information is passed.
- Proposed methods and metrics for verifying consistency.
- An implementation plan for integrating these checks.
- Discussion on tracking semantic transformations.

## 2. Analysis of Task Specification and Result Structures in Boomerang

Understanding how task information flows between parent and child tasks is fundamental to designing effective consistency checks. Based on the "Boomerang Task System Architecture Analysis" (Task 0.1 output: `research/synthesis/boomerang_task_system_analysis.md`), the key structures are:

### 2.1. Parent Task Specification (Input to Child Task)

When a parent task (typically in Orchestrator mode) delegates work, it uses the `new_task` tool. The core of the specification for the child task is contained within the `message` parameter of this tool.

-   **Content of `message`**:
    -   **Context**: All necessary background information from the parent task or previous subtasks required for the child to complete its work.
    -   **Scope**: A clearly defined boundary specifying exactly what the subtask should accomplish.
    -   **Constraints**: An explicit statement that the subtask should *only* perform the work outlined and not deviate.
    -   **Reporting Instructions**: An instruction for the subtask to signal completion using the `attempt_completion` tool, providing a concise yet thorough summary of the outcome in its `result` parameter.
    -   **Instruction Precedence**: A statement that these specific instructions from the parent supersede any conflicting general instructions the child task's mode might have.
-   **Mechanism**: The `new_task` tool (`src/core/tools/newTaskTool.ts`) takes this `message` and initializes a new `Task` instance (`src/core/task/Task.ts`) for the child, operating in the specified mode.

### 2.2. Child Task Result (Output to Parent Task)

When a child task completes its work, it reports back to the parent.

-   **Content of `result`**:
    -   The child task prepares a concise summary of its outcome.
    -   This summary is passed as the `result` parameter to the `attempt_completion` tool.
-   **Mechanism**:
    -   The `attempt_completion` tool signals the end of the child task.
    -   The Boomerang system then facilitates the resumption of the paused parent task. The child's `result` is passed as the `lastMessage` argument to the parent's `resumePausedTask` method within its `Task` instance.
    -   The `resumePausedTask` method incorporates this `lastMessage` into the parent's conversation history, often formatted as: `[new_task completed] Result: ${lastMessage}`. This `lastMessage` becomes the primary record of the child's output available to the parent.

### 2.3. Implications for Consistency Checking

-   The **parent's `message`** (delegated instructions) serves as the "source of truth" for the intended semantics of the child task.
-   The **child's `result`** (from `attempt_completion`) is the "output" that needs to be checked against this source of truth.
-   Any consistency verification mechanism must compare these two pieces of information, considering the potential for different modes of operation (e.g., natural language instructions from Orchestrator vs. code output from Code mode).

## 3. Proposed Methods and Metrics for Semantic Consistency Verification

To verify semantic consistency between a parent task's objectives (conveyed in its `message` to the child) and the results produced by its child task (conveyed in the `result` from `attempt_completion`), a combination of techniques can be employed. These methods aim to detect if the child task has "drifted" from the parent's original request, even if the child's output is internally consistent for its own mode.

### 3.1. LLM-as-a-Judge (Primary Method)

This approach leverages a separate LLM instance to evaluate the semantic alignment between the parent's instructions and the child's output.

-   **Input to Judge LLM**:
    1.  Parent Task's Delegated Instructions (`message` content).
    2.  Child Task's Result (`result` content).
    3.  (Optional) Parent Task's Mode.
    4.  (Optional) Child Task's Mode.
-   **Prompting Strategy for Judge LLM**:
    The prompt should ask the Judge LLM to assess:
    -   **Direct Adherence**: "Does the child's result directly and fully address all explicit instructions, requirements, and scope defined in the parent's delegated instructions? Provide a Yes/No answer and a brief explanation."
    -   **Goal Alignment**: "Considering the parent's instructions, has the child task successfully achieved the intended goal? Provide a Yes/No answer and a brief explanation."
    -   **Semantic Drift Detection**: "Has the child task significantly drifted from the parent's original request (e.g., by changing scope, addressing a different problem, or providing an output irrelevant to the instructions)? Provide a Yes/No answer and a brief explanation."
    -   **Completeness Check**: "Were there any specific parts of the parent's instructions that the child's result failed to address or seemed to misinterpret? If so, list them."
    -   **Overall Alignment Score**: "On a scale of 1 (Not Aligned) to 5 (Perfectly Aligned), how well does the child's result semantically align with the parent's delegated instructions? Provide a single numerical score."
-   **Metrics**:
    -   Binary (Yes/No) flags for Adherence, Goal Alignment, and Drift.
    -   Qualitative explanations for each assessment.
    -   List of unaddressed/misinterpreted instructions.
    -   Numerical Alignment Score (1-5).
-   **Advantages**: Can handle nuanced semantic comparisons, including differences in modality (e.g., natural language instructions vs. code output). Can provide human-readable explanations for its judgments.
-   **Challenges**: Cost of LLM calls, potential for the judge LLM to have its own biases or misinterpretations, latency.

### 3.2. Embedding-Based Similarity

This method uses vector embeddings to quantify the semantic similarity between the parent's instructions and the child's result.

-   **Process**:
    1.  Generate a vector embedding for the parent's `message` (or key instructional components).
    2.  Generate a vector embedding for the child's `result`. If the result is code, a code-specific embedding model (e.g., CodeBERT, UniXCoder) or a summary of the code's functionality could be embedded.
    3.  Calculate the cosine similarity between the two embeddings.
-   **Metrics**:
    -   Cosine Similarity Score (typically between -1 and 1, or 0 and 1).
-   **Advantages**: Computationally less expensive than LLM-as-a-Judge once embeddings are generated. Can provide a quick quantitative measure.
-   **Challenges**:
    -   High textual similarity doesn't always equate to true semantic alignment (e.g., child rephrases problem without solving it).
    -   Low textual similarity doesn't always mean misalignment (e.g., concise instruction leading to detailed code).
    -   Requires careful selection of embedding models, especially for multi-modal comparisons (text vs. code).
    -   May need calibration to determine meaningful similarity thresholds for "consistency."

### 3.3. Keyword/Concept Extraction and Overlap

This technique focuses on the presence and relevance of key terms and concepts.

-   **Process**:
    1.  Extract key terms, entities, and concepts from the parent's `message` (e.g., using NLP libraries like spaCy, or an LLM).
    2.  Extract key terms, entities, and concepts from the child's `result`.
    3.  Measure the overlap and relevance (e.g., Jaccard index, TF-IDF weighted overlap, or checking if child's concepts are hyponyms/hypernyms or related to parent's concepts).
-   **Metrics**:
    -   Overlap score (e.g., Jaccard index).
    -   Percentage of parent's key concepts addressed in child's result.
-   **Advantages**: Simple to implement, interpretable.
-   **Challenges**: Surface-level; may miss deeper semantic connections or disconnections. Sensitive to phrasing.

### 3.4. Instruction Fulfillment Checklist

This method breaks down the parent's request into actionable items and checks their completion.

-   **Process**:
    1.  Use an LLM or rule-based parser to decompose the parent's `message` into a checklist of discrete instructions, deliverables, or questions to be answered.
    2.  For each item in the checklist, evaluate if the child's `result` provides evidence of its fulfillment. This evaluation can be done by another LLM call or a targeted search/pattern matching.
-   **Metrics**:
    -   Percentage of instructions fulfilled.
    -   List of fulfilled and unfulfilled instructions.
-   **Advantages**: Provides granular feedback on what was accomplished versus requested.
-   **Challenges**: Reliant on accurate decomposition of instructions; fulfillment checking can be complex.

### 3.5. Summarization and Abstract Comparison

This approach compares higher-level summaries of the parent's request and the child's output.

-   **Process**:
    1.  Generate a concise summary of the core request in the parent's `message` (e.g., "Parent wants a Python function that sorts a list of numbers").
    2.  Generate a concise summary of what the child's `result` achieves (e.g., "Child provided a Python class for advanced data structure manipulation including sorting").
    3.  Compare these two summaries using embedding-based similarity or a focused LLM-as-a-Judge call.
-   **Metrics**: Similarity score between summaries; LLM judgment on summary alignment.
-   **Advantages**: Can normalize for differences in verbosity and modality (e.g., text vs. code). Focuses on the "gist" of the interaction.
-   **Challenges**: Quality of summaries is critical; information can be lost during summarization.

### 3.6. Detecting Drift Beyond Mode-Specific Guardrails

A key aspect of cross-task consistency is identifying when a child task, while adhering to its own mode's semantic guardrails (as per Task 1.1), still deviates from the *specific delegated instructions* of the parent.

-   **Focus of Detection**: The methods above, particularly LLM-as-a-Judge and Instruction Fulfillment Checklist, are well-suited for this. The evaluation must be primed to compare the child's output against the *parent's specific `message`*, not just the general expectations of the child's mode.
-   **Example Scenario Revisited**:
    -   Parent (Orchestrator) `message`: "Write a simple Python function to add two numbers and return the sum."
    -   Child (Code Mode) `result`: (Provides a complex Python class for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, including an `add` method).
    -   **Mode-Specific Check (Task 1.1)**: The code is high quality, well-structured Python. PASS.
    -   **Cross-Task Consistency Check (Task 1.2)**:
        -   LLM-as-a-Judge: Might flag "Scope Drift" (function vs. class) and "Completeness" (simple addition vs. complex arithmetic). Score: 2/5.
        -   Instruction Fulfillment: "Simple function" - NO. "Add two numbers" - YES (but within a class). "Return sum" - YES.
        -   This indicates a drift from the parent's specific request for simplicity and a function.

### 3.7. Combining Methods

A hybrid approach, potentially using a computationally cheaper method (like embedding similarity or keyword overlap) as an initial filter, followed by a more thorough LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation for borderline or potentially problematic cases, could offer a balance of accuracy and efficiency.

## 4. Implementation Plan for Integration into Boomerang System

Integrating semantic consistency checks requires careful consideration of the Boomerang task lifecycle to ensure checks are performed at the most impactful point with minimal disruption.

### 4.1. Integration Point

The primary integration point for cross-task semantic consistency checks should be **when a child task completes and its result is about to be processed by the parent task.**

-   **Trigger**: This occurs after the child task invokes the `attempt_completion` tool and before the parent task's `resumePausedTask` method fully processes the result and restores the parent's operational context.
-   **Location in Code (Conceptual)**:
    -   A new module/service, `CrossTaskSemanticVerifier`, would be responsible for these checks.
    -   The `Task.ts` (or a related Boomerang system controller) would invoke this verifier. When `attempt_completion` is called by a child, the system needs to:
        1.  Identify the parent task.
        2.  Retrieve the original `message` (delegated instructions) that the parent sent to this child. This might require storing this `message` or a reference to it in the child task's metadata or making it retrievable via the parent-child task link.
        3.  Pass the parent's `message` and the child's `result` (from `attempt_completion`) to the `CrossTaskSemanticVerifier`.

### 4.2. Verification Workflow

1.  **Child Task Completion**: Child task calls `attempt_completion(childResult)`.
2.  **System Interception**: The Boomerang system intercepts this event.
3.  **Context Retrieval**:
    -   Retrieve `parentInstructions` (the `message` originally sent by the parent to this child).
    -   Retrieve `childOutput` (the `childResult` from `attempt_completion`).
4.  **Invoke Verifier**: Call `CrossTaskSemanticVerifier.verify(parentInstructions, childOutput)`.
5.  **Verification Process**: The verifier applies the chosen method(s) (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge, hybrid approach).
6.  **Receive Verification Outcome**: The verifier returns a result, including:
    -   Consistency status (e.g., `CONSISTENT`, `POTENTIAL_DRIFT`, `SIGNIFICANT_DRIFT`).
    -   Alignment score.
    -   Reasoning/details of drift (if any).
7.  **Outcome Handling (by Boomerang System)**:
    -   **If `CONSISTENT`**:
        -   Proceed with the normal `resumePausedTask(childOutput)` for the parent.
        -   Log the consistency check outcome (score, method used) for monitoring.
    -   **If `POTENTIAL_DRIFT` or `SIGNIFICANT_DRIFT`**:
        Several strategies can be adopted, configurable perhaps by system settings or parent task preferences:
        -   **Strategy A: Inform Parent with Augmented Result**:
            -   The `childOutput` passed to `resumePausedTask` is augmented with the drift analysis. For example: `"[new_task completed with potential semantic drift (Score: 2/5). Reason: Child focused on X, parent requested Y.] Original Result: ${childOutput}"`.
            -   The parent task (especially Orchestrator) can then decide how to proceed (e.g., ask child to revise, discard, accept with caution).
        -   **Strategy B: Automatic Clarification Loop (Advanced)**:
            -   The system temporarily holds the result from the parent.
            -   A new, system-initiated clarification sub-task is sent back to the *original child task's mode/instance* (if possible, or a new one with context), explaining the detected drift and asking for revision or clarification.
            -   This adds complexity but could proactively resolve drift.
        -   **Strategy C: Alert and Hold**:
            -   Log the significant drift.
            -   Potentially alert a human supervisor or place the parent task in a special "awaiting drift resolution" state.
            -   The parent task is not immediately resumed with the drifted result.
        -   **Strategy D: Conditional Resumption**:
            -   Based on drift severity, the system might allow resumption but flag the interaction heavily in logs and UI.
8.  **Logging**: All verification attempts, methods used, inputs, and outcomes must be logged comprehensively in `/research/raw/task_1.2/cross_task_consistency_verification_log.md` and potentially within the `.roo/logs/` structure.

### 4.3. Data Requirements for Verification

To perform verification, the system needs access to:
-   The unique ID of the parent task.
-   The unique ID of the child task.
-   The original `message` (instructions) sent from the parent to this specific child task instance. This implies that when a parent task creates a child task, this `message` needs to be stored and associated with the child task, or be easily retrievable from the parent task's history when the child completes.
-   The `result` string provided by the child task via `attempt_completion`.

### 4.4. Configuration

The semantic verification process should be configurable:
-   Enable/disable cross-task checks globally or per-mode.
-   Set thresholds for drift scores.
-   Choose the default outcome handling strategy for detected drift.
-   Select the verification method(s) to be used.

## 5. Tracking Semantic Transformations Between Task Levels

Semantic information can be transformed, and sometimes lost or misinterpreted, as it flows between parent and child tasks. Understanding and tracking these transformations is vital for diagnosing issues and improving the overall reliability of the Boomerang system.

### 5.1. Points of Semantic Transformation/Loss

1.  **Parent to Child: Task Delegation (`new_task` `message`)**
    *   **Abstraction/Summarization by Parent**: The parent (e.g., Orchestrator) might summarize a broader goal into a specific instruction for the child. Nuance from the parent's larger context could be lost if not explicitly included in the `message`.
    *   **Instruction Ambiguity**: If the parent's `message` is ambiguous, the child task's interpretation will define the subsequent semantic path, which might diverge from the parent's true intent.
    *   **Contextual Scoping**: The parent decides what context to pass. Insufficient context can lead to the child making assumptions or lacking critical information, altering the semantic outcome.
    *   **Mode-Specific Interpretation by Child**: The child task's mode (e.g., Code, Research) will interpret the parent's `message` through its own specialized lens. A request for "analysis" might mean code analysis to Code mode but literature review to Research mode. The parent's `message` must be precise enough to guide this.
    *   **Implicit Knowledge Gap**: The parent might assume the child has certain implicit knowledge that it lacks, leading to misinterpretation.

2.  **Child to Parent: Task Result (`attempt_completion` `result`)**
    *   **Summarization by Child**: The child's `result` is typically a summary of its work. Details of the process, alternative solutions considered, or raw data might be omitted, leading to a loss of semantic richness for the parent.
    *   **Serialization of Complex Outputs**: If a child task produces a complex artifact (e.g., a full document, a dataset, multiple code files), the string `result` is only a representation or reference. The full semantic content resides in the artifact, which the parent might not directly "understand" without further processing.
    *   **Loss of Child's Internal State/Reasoning**: The `result` may not capture the child's internal reasoning, confidence levels, or uncertainties unless explicitly articulated.
    *   **Formatting and Language**: The child's `result` is a natural language string. If the child's work was, for example, creating a complex data structure in memory, translating this to a descriptive string can involve transformation and potential loss.

### 5.2. Methods for Tracking Semantic Transformations

1.  **Comprehensive Logging**:
    *   **Parent's Delegation**: Log the exact `message` (including all provided context) sent to the child task, alongside the parent and child task IDs.
    *   **Child's Interpretation (Optional but Ideal)**: If feasible, the child task could emit an initial "understanding" or "plan" based on the parent's `message` before starting its main work. This could be logged and compared.
    *   **Child's Result**: Log the exact `result` string from `attempt_completion`.
    *   **Artifact Referencing**: If the child produces artifacts (files, etc.), the `result` should contain stable references (e.g., paths) to these artifacts, and these references should be logged.
    *   **Consistency Check Outcomes**: Log the inputs, outputs, and detailed reasoning from the cross-task semantic consistency checks (Section 3 & 4).

2.  **Semantic Thread ID / Requirement Tracing**:
    *   For complex, multi-level task decompositions, assign unique IDs to core semantic requirements or goals originating from the top-level user request.
    *   As tasks are delegated, these requirement IDs should be passed down or referenced in the child task's `message`.
    *   The child task's `result` should ideally indicate how it addressed these specific requirement IDs.
    *   This allows tracing how a high-level semantic goal is transformed and (hopefully) fulfilled through the task hierarchy.

3.  **Structured Task Inputs and Outputs (Future Enhancement)**:
    *   While currently `message` and `result` are primarily strings, evolving towards more structured data formats (e.g., JSON objects with defined schemas for task inputs/outputs per mode) could reduce ambiguity and make semantic transformations more explicit and machine-parsable.
    *   For example, a parent delegating a "file creation" task could provide a structured input like `{ "action": "create_file", "path": "...", "content_summary": "..." }` and expect a structured output like `{ "status": "success", "file_path": "...", "notes": "..." }`.

4.  **Differential Semantic Analysis**:
    *   After a child task completes, compare the semantic content of the parent's original `message` with the child's `result`.
    *   Identify:
        *   **Preserved Concepts**: Concepts present in both.
        *   **Added Concepts**: New concepts introduced by the child (elaboration, solution details).
        *   **Lost Concepts**: Concepts in parent's request not evident in child's result.
        *   **Transformed Concepts**: Concepts present in both but with altered meaning or scope.
    *   This analysis can be performed using LLMs or advanced NLP techniques and logged.

5.  **Visualizing Task and Semantic Flow**:
    *   Develop tools to visualize the Boomerang task graph (parent-child relationships).
    *   Overlay this graph with information about semantic consistency scores and identified transformations at each link. This can help developers and users understand where semantic drift is occurring.

By actively tracking these transformations, the system can build a richer understanding of its own operational semantics, enabling better debugging, improved instruction generation by the Orchestrator, and more refined consistency checks over time.

## 6. Examples of Semantic Consistency Checks

This section provides illustrative examples of how the proposed cross-task semantic consistency checks would function. We will primarily use the "LLM-as-a-Judge" method for these examples due to its versatility.

### Example 1: Orchestrator to Code Mode (Scope Adherence)

-   **Parent Task (Orchestrator Mode) `message` to Child (Code Mode)**:
    ```
    # Task: Create Email Validation Function

    ## Context
    We need a utility function for validating email addresses in our JavaScript frontend.

    ## Scope
    - Create a single JavaScript function named `validateEmail`.
    - The function should take one string argument (the email).
    - It should return `true` if the email format is valid, `false` otherwise.
    - Use a common regular expression for email validation.
    - Include a JSDoc comment explaining the function, its parameters, and return value.
    - Do NOT create a class or any other complex structures. Focus only on this single function.

    ## Expected Output
    The JavaScript code for the `validateEmail` function.

    Signal completion using `attempt_completion` with the function code as the result. These instructions supersede any general Code mode instructions.
    ```

-   **Child Task (Code Mode) `result` (Scenario A - Consistent)**:
    ```javascript
    /**
     * Validates an email address using a regular expression pattern.
     * @param {string} email - The email address to validate.
     * @returns {boolean} - True if email is valid, false otherwise.
     */
    function validateEmail(email) {
      if (typeof email !== 'string') return false;
      const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
      return emailRegex.test(email);
    }
    ```

-   **Cross-Task Consistency Check (LLM-as-a-Judge Output)**:
    -   **Direct Adherence**: Yes. The result provides a single JavaScript function `validateEmail` that takes a string, uses a regex, returns a boolean, and includes JSDoc.
    -   **Goal Alignment**: Yes. The goal of creating an email validation function was achieved.
    -   **Semantic Drift Detection**: No. The output directly matches the requested scope and constraints.
    -   **Completeness Check**: All instructions appear to be addressed.
    -   **Overall Alignment Score**: 5/5.
    -   **System Action**: Proceed. Log consistency.

-   **Child Task (Code Mode) `result` (Scenario B - Drifted: Scope Expansion)**:
    ```javascript
    // Advanced Form Validation Suite
    class FormValidator {
      constructor() {
        this.emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
      }

      /**
       * Validates an email address.
       * @param {string} email - The email to validate.
       * @returns {boolean}
       */
      validateEmail(email) {
        if (typeof email !== 'string') return false;
        return this.emailRegex.test(email);
      }

      validatePassword(password) { /* ...complex password logic... */ }
      validateUsername(username) { /* ...username logic... */ }
    }
    // Usage: const validator = new FormValidator(); validator.validateEmail("test@example.com");
    ```
-   **Cross-Task Consistency Check (LLM-as-a-Judge Output)**:
    -   **Direct Adherence**: No. The parent requested a single function, but a class with multiple methods was provided. While an email validation method is present, it's not a standalone function as requested.
    -   **Goal Alignment**: Partially. Email validation is possible, but not in the requested format.
    -   **Semantic Drift Detection**: Yes. The child task expanded the scope significantly from a single utility function to a validation suite/class. The constraint "Do NOT create a class" was violated.
    -   **Completeness Check**: The core email validation logic is present, but the structural requirement (single function) and constraint (no class) were not met.
    -   **Overall Alignment Score**: 2/5.
    -   **System Action**: (e.g., Strategy A) Inform Parent: `"[new_task completed with semantic drift (Score: 2/5). Reason: Output is a class, not a single function as requested. Scope expanded beyond email validation.] Original Result: ${childOutput}"`

### Example 2: Orchestrator to Research Mode (Focus Adherence)

-   **Parent Task (Orchestrator Mode) `message` to Child (Research Mode)**:
    ```
    # Task: Research Python Web Scraping Libraries

    ## Context
    We are planning to build a web scraper for product data. We need to choose the best Python library for this.

    ## Scope
    - Research and compare the top 3-4 Python libraries for web scraping (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Requests-HTML).
    - Focus the comparison on: ease of use, handling dynamic JavaScript-rendered content, speed, community support, and scalability.
    - Do NOT provide implementation details or code examples for a full scraper.
    - Conclude with a recommendation for which library (or combination) would be best suited for scraping product data from e-commerce sites that may use JavaScript.

    ## Expected Output
    A summary document comparing the libraries and a final recommendation.

    Signal completion using `attempt_completion` with your research summary and recommendation.
    ```

-   **Child Task (Research Mode) `result` (Scenario A - Consistent)**:
    ```
    Research Summary: Python Web Scraping Libraries

    This research compared BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, and Requests-HTML for web scraping product data.

    - BeautifulSoup: Excellent for parsing HTML/XML, easy to use with Requests. Does not handle JS rendering natively. Good community.
    - Scrapy: Powerful framework, asynchronous, fast, scalable. Steeper learning curve. Can be combined with tools like Splash or Selenium for JS.
    - Selenium: Browser automation tool, excellent for JS-heavy sites. Slower due to full browser rendering. Good for complex interactions.
    - Requests-HTML: Aims to combine Requests' simplicity with some JS support (via Chromium). Simpler than Selenium for basic JS.

    Recommendation: For scraping e-commerce sites with potential JavaScript, a combination of Scrapy (for overall framework and speed) integrated with Selenium or Playwright (for robust JS rendering on specific pages) is recommended. If simplicity is paramount and JS needs are minimal, Requests-HTML could be an alternative. BeautifulSoup remains useful for parsing if another tool handles fetching dynamic content.
    ```

-   **Cross-Task Consistency Check (LLM-as-a-Judge Output)**:
    -   **Direct Adherence**: Yes. The result compares relevant libraries on specified criteria and provides a recommendation. It avoids full scraper implementation.
    -   **Goal Alignment**: Yes. The goal of researching and recommending a library was met.
    -   **Semantic Drift Detection**: No. The output stays within the defined research scope.
    -   **Completeness Check**: All aspects of the request seem covered.

    Python Web Scraping Solution

    I've researched the libraries and found Scrapy to be excellent. Here's a basic Scrapy spider to get you started on scraping product data:

    ```python
    import scrapy

    class ProductSpider(scrapy.Spider):
        name = "product_scraper"
        start_urls = ['http://example-ecommerce.com/products']

        def parse(self, response):
            for product in response.css('div.product-item'):
                yield {
                    'name': product.css('h2.name ::text').get(),
                    'price': product.css('span.price ::text').get(),
                    'link': product.css('a.product-link ::attr(href)').get(),
                }
            
            next_page = response.css('a.next-page ::attr(href)').get()
            if next_page is not None:
                yield response.follow(next_page, self.parse)
    ```
    This spider will extract product names, prices, and links. You can run it using the Scrapy CLI. While BeautifulSoup is simpler for static sites, Scrapy offers better scalability for e-commerce. Selenium is too slow for large-scale scraping.

-   **Cross-Task Consistency Check (LLM-as-a-Judge Output)**:
    -   **Direct Adherence**: No. The parent explicitly stated "Do NOT provide implementation details or code examples for a full scraper." The output primarily consists of code. The comparative research aspect is minimal.
    -   **Goal Alignment**: Partially. A library (Scrapy) is implicitly recommended, but the core task was research and comparison, not implementation.
    -   **Semantic Drift Detection**: Yes. The child task drifted significantly into implementation, violating a negative constraint and shifting focus from research to coding.
    -   **Completeness Check**: The detailed comparison of multiple libraries on specified criteria is missing.
    -   **Overall Alignment Score**: 1/5.
    -   **System Action**: (e.g., Strategy A) Inform Parent: `"[new_task completed with semantic drift (Score: 1/5). Reason: Output provided implementation code instead of the requested library comparison and violated the 'no implementation' constraint.] Original Result: ${childOutput}"`

## 7. Conclusion

Verifying semantic consistency between parent and child tasks is a critical layer of defense against error propagation and workflow degradation in Roo Code's Boomerang system. By implementing the proposed checks—primarily leveraging LLM-as-a-Judge capabilities, supported by other NLP techniques—Roo Code can ensure that delegated subtasks not only perform their mode-specific functions correctly but also align closely with the precise intent and scope defined by their parent tasks.

This cross-task semantic validation will enhance the reliability and predictability of complex, multi-step operations, leading to more coherent task execution and higher quality final outputs. The integration of these checks, coupled with robust logging and the tracking of semantic transformations, will provide deeper insights into the system's behavior and offer mechanisms for continuous improvement of both the AI's performance and the task management framework itself. While challenges in terms of computational cost and verifier accuracy exist, a phased implementation and ongoing refinement will allow Roo Code to progressively strengthen its semantic integrity.
