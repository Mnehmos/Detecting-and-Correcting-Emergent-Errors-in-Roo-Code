# Error Visualization Enhancements for Roo Code

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines proposed UX improvements for visualizing potential errors within the Roo Code environment. The goal is to enhance error awareness, reduce cognitive load on users, and provide clear, actionable insights to facilitate rapid error understanding and resolution. These designs are informed by best practices in error visualization, information design, cognitive psychology, and UX principles for complex systems.

## 2. Research Synthesis: Best Practices and Principles

Effective error visualization in complex software, particularly AI-driven tools like Roo Code, hinges on several key principles:

### 2.1. Clarity and Communication
-   **Unambiguous Messaging:** Error messages must be clear, concise, and use simple language. They should explain what happened, why, and suggest resolution paths. (Source: 01, 04)
-   **Contextual Information:** Errors should be displayed in close proximity to their source, providing immediate context (e.g., specific code block, UI element). (Source: 02, 03, 04)
-   **Avoid Jargon:** Technical jargon should be minimized unless the target user group is highly technical and familiar with the terms.

### 2.2. Visibility and Noticeability
-   **Prominent Indicators:** Use highly visible cues such as bold text, high-contrast colors (commonly red, but with accessibility considerations), icons, and subtle animations to make errors easily identifiable. (Source: 01, 03, 04)
-   **Redundancy:** Do not rely solely on color. Combine color with icons or text labels for accessibility. (Source: 03)
-   **Persistence:** Avoid transient messages (like auto-hiding tooltips) for critical errors; users should be able to view the error and the context simultaneously. (Source: 03)

### 2.3. Actionability and Guidance
-   **Suggest Next Steps:** Visualizations should guide users toward resolution by suggesting potential causes or direct next steps. (Source: 02)
-   **Interactive Elements:** Incorporate interactivity, such as hover-over tooltips for more details or clickable elements that lead to documentation or suggested fixes. (Source: 01, 02)
-   **Easy Recovery:** Design for forgiveness. Users should be able to easily edit inputs or undo actions related to an error. (Source: 03)

### 2.4. Cognitive Load Management
-   **Simplicity:** Keep visualizations as simple as possible. Avoid clutter and visual noise by focusing on relevant information. (Source: 01, 05)
-   **Match Mental Models:** Align visualizations with users' existing mental schemas and learned graphic conventions to reduce cognitive transformations. (Source: 05)
-   **Differentiate Severity:** Use different visual treatments for varying error severities (e.g., subtle notifications for warnings, modal dialogs for critical errors) to help users prioritize. (Source: 03, 04)
-   **Avoid Premature Alerts:** Display errors at appropriate times (e.g., after input completion) unless real-time feedback is crucial for preventing costly mistakes. (Source: 03, 04)

### 2.5. Transparency and Trust (Especially for AI Agents)
-   **Explainable AI Actions:** If an AI agent is involved in error detection or resolution, its actions and reasoning should be transparent. Show steps taken and why. (Source: 02)
-   **Real-time Feedback:** Provide real-time feedback on errors as they occur, especially in interactive development environments. (Source: 01, 02)

### 2.6. Trend Visualization and Monitoring
-   **Dashboards and Logs:** Use dashboards to show error rates, frequencies, and trends over time. Log analysis can reveal patterns. (Source: 01, 02)
-   This is particularly relevant for system-level error monitoring rather than immediate per-instance error feedback.

### 2.7. Customization and User Control
-   **User Preferences:** Allow users to customize some aspects of error visualization if appropriate for the user base (e.g., filtering, sorting). (Source: 01)

### 2.8. Error Prevention
-   **Proactive Design:** The best error message is no error message. Design interfaces to prevent errors where possible (e.g., clear input constraints, good visual hierarchy). (Source: 03, 04)

## 3. Design Rationale for Roo Code Error Visualizations

The following design rationale builds upon the synthesized research to propose error visualization strategies tailored for Roo Code. The primary goals are:
*   **Immediate Awareness:** Users must instantly recognize that a potential issue has been flagged.
*   **Clear Understanding:** The nature, location, and severity of the error should be quickly comprehensible.
*   **Actionable Guidance:** Users should understand what they can or should do next.
*   **Minimized Disruption:** Visualizations should be informative but not overly intrusive, respecting the user's workflow.
*   **Integration with Intervention Points:** Designs must seamlessly integrate with the strategic intervention points identified in Task 5.1 (`research/synthesis/strategic_intervention_points_framework.md`).

## 4. UI Mockup Concepts and Design Rationale

The following conceptual mockups describe how potential errors could be visualized within Roo Code. These are textual descriptions intended to guide future visual design and prototyping. They integrate with the intervention mechanisms outlined in `strategic_intervention_points_framework.md`.

### 4.1. General Error Indication Principles:
*   **Consistent Iconography:**
    *   **Critical Error (Red Stop Sign/Octagon Icon):** Indicates a severe issue that likely halts the current operation and requires immediate user attention.
    *   **Warning/Potential Issue (Yellow Triangle Icon):** Indicates a non-critical issue, a low confidence score, or a potential deviation that the user should be aware of. Roo might be able to proceed but user review is advised.
    *   **Information/Suggestion (Blue 'i' Icon or Lightbulb Icon):** For proactive clarifications, suggestions, or alternative interpretations when ambiguity is detected.
*   **Color Coding:** Use red for critical errors, yellow/amber for warnings, and blue for informational messages, ensuring high contrast and providing non-color-based cues (icons, text).
*   **Location Specificity:** Visual cues should appear directly adjacent to or highlight the source of the error (e.g., a specific line in a code editor, a problematic parameter in a tool use request, a step in a task plan).
*   **"Task Paused - Awaiting Input" State:** When an error triggers an intervention requiring user input, the Roo Code UI should clearly indicate this state, perhaps in a status bar or task overview panel.

### 4.2. Mockup Concept 1: Inline Code Error/Warning
*   **Context:** Roo is generating or modifying code, and an error (e.g., syntax error, semantic drift, boundary violation related to a specific code segment) is detected.
*   **Visualization:**
    *   The specific line(s) of code are highlighted (e.g., red underline for errors, yellow for warnings).
    *   An icon (critical or warning) appears in the gutter next to the line.
    *   **On Hover/Click (Gutter Icon):** A popover/tooltip appears with:
        *   **Error/Warning Title:** Concise summary (e.g., "Semantic Drift Detected," "Potential Null Pointer").
        *   **Detailed Message:** Clear explanation of the issue (e.g., "This function's output type no longer matches its documented return type of 'string'. Current inferred type: 'integer'.")
        *   **Source:** (If applicable, e.g., "Semantic Guardrail: Type Consistency Check").
        *   **Suggested Actions (Buttons/Links):**
            *   "View Diff" (if applicable, shows previous vs. current state).
            *   "Ask Roo to Fix" (initiates a guided fix process).
            *   "Explain Further" (provides more detailed context or links to documentation).
            *   "Ignore (This Instance)" / "Add Exception" (for warnings, with caution).
*   **Intervention Integration:** This directly supports "Error-Triggered Intervention" and can be part of a "Cumulative Change Review." If critical, it would trigger a "Task Pause."

### 4.3. Mockup Concept 2: Tool Use Confirmation with Risk/Error Indication
*   **Context:** Roo requests to use a tool (e.g., `apply_diff`, `execute_command`), and a potential issue is flagged (e.g., high-risk file, command with potential side-effects, low confidence in the tool's applicability).
*   **Visualization (Modal Dialog - as per `strategic_intervention_points_framework.md`):**
    *   **Dialog Title:** "Tool Use Request: [Tool Name]" with a relevant icon (e.g., warning icon if risk is detected).
    *   **Core Message:** "Roo proposes to use the `[Tool Name]` tool with the following parameters:"
        *   Parameters are clearly listed.
        *   **If Risk/Warning:** A highlighted section (e.g., yellow background) appears:
            *   "**Potential Issue:** [Description of risk, e.g., 'Modifying critical configuration file: `config.prod.json`,' or 'Command `rm -rf *` has high destructive potential,' or 'Low confidence (55%) that this tool is appropriate for the current step.']"
    *   **Context/Rationale:** "Reason for use: [Roo's explanation for why it needs this tool]."
    *   **Action Buttons:**
        *   "Approve"
        *   "Approve (View Details First)" (expands to show more context or a diff if applicable)
        *   "Deny"
        *   "Ask for Alternatives" / "Modify Parameters"
*   **Intervention Integration:** Directly implements "Enhanced Tool Use Approval" and "Error-Triggered Intervention" (if the 'error' is low confidence or detected risk).

### 4.4. Mockup Concept 3: Ambiguity/Low Confidence Clarification (Inline Chat/Suggestion)
*   **Context:** Roo has low confidence in its interpretation of a user prompt or a generated piece of content, or detects ambiguity.
*   **Visualization (Non-modal, inline suggestion - as per `strategic_intervention_points_framework.md`):**
    *   A subtle notification bar or a chat-like bubble appears within the Roo interface (e.g., near the main input/output area).
    *   **Icon:** Blue 'i' or lightbulb.
    *   **Message:** "I've drafted [X], but I'm unsure about [specific aspect]. Did you mean A or B?" or "I can proceed in a couple of ways regarding [topic]. Which do you prefer?"
    *   **Options (Buttons/Quick Replies):**
        *   "[Option A]"
        *   "[Option B]"
        *   "Explain Options More"
        *   "Neither, let me clarify..." (opens input field)
*   **Intervention Integration:** Implements "Proactive Clarification (Low Confidence)" and uses "Inline Chat Notifications/Suggestions."

### 4.5. Mockup Concept 4: Global Error/Notification Panel
*   **Context:** A central place to view a summary of all active errors, warnings, or pending interventions, especially if multiple issues arise or if the user navigates away from the immediate context of an error.
*   **Visualization:**
    *   A dedicated icon in the main UI (e.g., a bell with a badge count, or a status indicator).
    *   **On Click:** Opens a panel/sidebar listing:
        *   Each error/warning/intervention point.
        *   Icon, brief title, source (e.g., file, task step).
        *   Timestamp.
        *   Clicking an item navigates the user to the full context of that issue (e.g., opens the relevant file and highlights the error as in Mockup 1).
*   **Intervention Integration:** Supports "Task Pause & Status Update" by providing a clear overview of why a task might be paused.

## 5. Tailoring Visualizations to Different Error Types

The specific information and suggested actions will vary based on the error type:

*   **Semantic Drift (Task 1.1):**
    *   **Visualization:** Inline code highlighting (Mockup 1). Diff view showing deviation from original intent or previous version.
    *   **Message:** "Semantic Drift: This [code/output] seems to deviate from its original purpose of [X]. It now appears to be doing [Y]."
    *   **Actions:** "Revert to last stable," "Accept change," "Guide Roo to correct."
*   **Boundary Violations (Task 2.1):**
    *   **Visualization:** Modal for critical violations (e.g., attempting to access restricted files), inline for warnings (e.g., nearing a token limit for a sub-component).
    *   **Message:** "Boundary Violation: Attempt to [action] on [resource] which is outside allowed scope ([reason/policy])."
    *   **Actions:** "Cancel operation," "Request override (if permissible)," "Modify plan to avoid."
*   **Cost Anomalies (Task 2.2):**
    *   **Visualization:** Warning notification (Mockup 3 or 4) or modal if exceeding a critical budget.
    *   **Message:** "Cost Anomaly: Predicted cost for this operation ([cost]) significantly exceeds typical costs ([average]) or budget limit ([limit])."
    *   **Actions:** "Proceed with caution," "Cancel operation," "Optimize plan for cost."
*   **Low Confidence Scores (General):**
    *   **Visualization:** Inline suggestion (Mockup 3) or warning icon next to the uncertain element.
    *   **Message:** "Low Confidence ([score]%): Roo is not fully certain about [generated content/action]. Review is recommended."
    *   **Actions:** "Accept," "Request alternatives," "Provide more context."
*   **Risky Auto-Approval (Task 3.1):**
    *   **Visualization:** Modal dialog (Mockup 2 style) before the auto-approved action is finalized.
    *   **Message:** "Pending Auto-Approval: Roo is about to [action] based on auto-approval rules. This action is flagged as potentially [risk type, e.g., high impact].
    *   **Actions:** "Confirm auto-approval," "Manually review first," "Cancel."

## 6. User Testing Considerations

To evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of these visualization designs:

1.  **Target Users:** Developers familiar with AI-assisted tools, and specifically users of Roo Code (if an existing user base is available).
2.  **Methodology:**
    *   **Moderated Usability Testing:** Users perform predefined tasks using a prototype (low or high fidelity) incorporating the error visualizations.
    *   **Think-Aloud Protocol:** Users verbalize their thoughts, confusions, and decision-making processes as they encounter errors.
    *   **Scenario-Based Testing:** Present users with scenarios where different types of errors are triggered.
3.  **Key Metrics to Collect:**
    *   **Error Detection Rate:** Do users notice the error visualizations?
    *   **Comprehension Time:** How quickly do users understand the nature and severity of the error?
    *   **Actionability:** Do users understand what to do next? Are the suggested actions clear?
    *   **Task Success Rate (with errors):** Can users successfully recover from or address the errors?
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Qualitative feedback (e.g., via NASA-TLX or SEQ - Single Ease Question) on how mentally taxing the error understanding and resolution process is.
    *   **User Satisfaction:** Surveys or interviews to gauge overall satisfaction with the error visualization system.
4.  **Prototype Fidelity:**
    *   Start with **low-fidelity mockups/wireframes** (like these textual descriptions or simple sketches) to test core concepts and information hierarchy.
    *   Progress to **interactive prototypes** for more realistic testing of workflows and interactions.
5.  **Specific Questions for Users:**
    *   "What did this error message/icon mean to you?"
    *   "What do you think caused this error?"
    *   "What would you do next after seeing this?"
    *   "Was the information provided sufficient?"
    *   "Was this visualization disruptive or helpful?"
    *   "How could this be made clearer?"
6.  **Iteration:** Use feedback to iterate on designs, refining the visualizations for clarity, actionability, and reduced cognitive load.

## 7. Conclusion (To be expanded)

Effective error visualization is paramount for user trust and efficient operation in Roo Code. By implementing clear, contextual, and actionable error indicators that integrate seamlessly with strategic intervention points, we can empower users to understand and address potential issues swiftly, minimizing cognitive load and enhancing the overall human-AI collaboration.
