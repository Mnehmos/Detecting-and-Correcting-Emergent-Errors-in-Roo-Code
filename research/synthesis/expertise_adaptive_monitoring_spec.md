## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a specification for implementing expertise-adaptive monitoring, intervention, and visualization within Roo Code. The goal is to provide a more personalized and effective user experience by tailoring the system's behavior to the classified or self-declared expertise level of the developer. This approach acknowledges that different users, from "vibe coders" to "weathered engineers," have varying needs for guidance, detail, and autonomy.

This specification draws upon research into user expertise classification, adaptive system design, and best practices for developer tools. It also considers the outputs of Task 5.1 (Strategic Intervention Points) and Task 5.2 (Error Visualization Enhancements).

## 2. Proposed Methods for Classifying User Expertise

A hybrid approach is recommended for classifying user expertise in Roo Code, combining explicit user input with potential for future implicit analysis:

### 2.1. Explicit User Self-Assessment (Phase 1)
*   **Mechanism:** During user onboarding or within profile settings, users can select an initial expertise level.
*   **Levels:**
    *   **Novice:** New to coding or the specific technologies/patterns Roo Code assists with. Prefers more guidance, simpler explanations, and proactive assistance. (Corresponds to "vibe coder" who might "set, forget, and if it works, I guess, use it.")
    *   **Intermediate:** Comfortable with core development concepts but still learning advanced techniques or specific domains. Seeks a balance of guidance and autonomy.
    *   **Expert:** Highly experienced, deeply knowledgeable about relevant technologies and patterns. Prefers concise information, minimal interruption for non-critical issues, and greater control. (Corresponds to "weathered engineer" who needs to "pay attention" to significant issues.)
*   **Rationale:** Simple to implement and provides an immediate baseline for adaptation.

### 2.2. Implicit Measures via Usage Pattern Analysis (Phase 3 - Future Enhancement)
*   **Mechanism:** (Requires telemetry and user consent) Roo Code could analyze:
    *   Frequency and type of advanced features used (e.g., custom rule creation, complex query usage).
    *   Efficiency in navigating and utilizing Roo Code's capabilities.
    *   Types of errors encountered and how they are resolved (e.g., reliance on Roo Code's suggestions vs. independent correction).
    *   Interaction with documentation or help features.
*   **Refinement:** This data could be used to suggest adjustments to the self-assessed expertise level or to subtly adapt features even within a chosen level.
*   **Rationale:** Provides a more dynamic and potentially accurate measure of expertise over time.

### 2.3. Project Context or Role-Based Assumptions (Optional Input)
*   **Mechanism:** Users could optionally specify the complexity of their current project or their primary role (e.g., "Frontend Developer," "Data Scientist," "Student").
*   **Influence:** This information could act as a weighting factor in the expertise model, particularly if certain roles or project types correlate with specific needs or common Roo Code usage patterns.
*   **Rationale:** Adds another layer of context for personalization.

## 3. Adaptation Rules Based on Expertise

The following rules outline how Roo Code's monitoring, intervention strategies (from Task 5.1), and visualization details (from Task 5.2) will adapt.

### 3.1. Monitoring Adaptations

| **Confirmation Req.**   | Higher for automated actions                                           | Medium, with clear review options                                         | Lower, especially for user-initiated or configured actions                                    |

### 3.3. Visualization Detail Adaptations

Refers to how errors and related information are presented to the user.

| Feature                 | Novice                                                                 | Intermediate                                                                 | Expert                                                                      |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Language & Jargon**   | Simple, clear, minimal jargon                                          | Standard technical terms, with tooltips/explanations available               | Assumes understanding of technical jargon                                   |
| **Information Density** | Low: Key info highlighted, progressive disclosure for details          | Medium: Balanced summary and detail, drill-down capabilities                 | High: Dense, information-rich displays, customizable views                  |
| **Default View**        | High-level summary, actionable insights                                | Dashboard with key metrics and error lists, configurable                     | Customizable dashboard, access to raw logs/data, advanced filtering         |
| **Guidance Cues**       | Visual cues for important info, suggested next steps                   | Contextual links, related information highlighted                            | Minimal cues, relies on user's ability to navigate and interpret data       |
| **Example Error Display** | "This error often means X. Try checking Y. [Learn more...]"            | "Error Z detected. Causes: A, B. Stack: [link]. Related: [link]."            | "Error Z (Type: T) at F. Details: [technical_data]. Affected: C1, C2."      |

## 4. Design for Personalized Monitoring Settings

To empower users and allow for fine-tuning beyond the broad expertise levels, Roo Code should offer personalized monitoring settings.

### 4.1. Core Settings:
*   **Global Expertise Level:**
    *   Options: [Novice | Intermediate | Expert] (Dropdown or similar selector).
    *   Description: "Choose the level that best describes your current experience with [relevant technologies/Roo Code]. This will set a baseline for how Roo Code assists you."
*   **Intervention Preferences:**
    *   **Proactivity Level:** [Low (Minimal interruptions) | Medium (Balanced suggestions) | High (Proactive guidance)] (Slider or radio buttons).
    *   **Suggestion Types:**
        *   `[ ]` Show suggestions for common errors
        *   `[ ]` Offer detailed explanations for errors
        *   `[ ]` Suggest potential automated corrections for minor issues
*   **Visualization Preferences:**
    *   **Information Detail:** [Concise (Overview) | Standard (Balanced) | Detailed (Technical deep-dive)] (Dropdown).
    *   `[ ]` Show advanced diagnostic panels by default.
*   **Notification Granularity:**
    *   For non-critical issues: [Minimal | Important Only | All Suggestions]

### 4.2. Advanced Settings (Potentially for Intermediate/Expert):
*   **Specific Rule Overrides:** Allow users to disable or change the sensitivity of specific Roo Code analysis rules or intervention triggers.
*   **Custom Alert Conditions:** (Future) Define custom conditions for when and how to be alerted.
*   **Data Point Selection for Dashboards:** (Future) Customize what data appears on their monitoring dashboard.

### 4.3. Feedback Mechanism:
*   Allow users to provide feedback on individual suggestions or interventions (e.g., "This was helpful," "This was not relevant," "This was too basic/complex"). This feedback can be used to refine the adaptive model over time.

### 4.4. "Preset" Modes:
*   **"Vibe Coder" Preset:**
    *   Corresponds to Novice/Low-Intermediate.
    *   Settings: High proactivity, detailed & simple visualizations, strong guidance, offers to automate.
*   **"Weathered Engineer" Preset:**
    *   Corresponds to Expert.
    *   Settings: Low proactivity for non-critical issues, concise/technical visualizations, high user control, minimal unsolicited automation.

## 5. Integration Plan for Roo Code

### Phase 1: Foundational Implementation
1.  **User Profile/Settings Storage:**
    *   Implement a simple mechanism to store user-selected expertise level (Novice, Intermediate, Expert) and basic preferences (e.g., intervention proactivity, visualization detail). This could initially be local storage if a full user profile system is not yet in place.
2.  **Core Adaptation Logic:**
    *   Implement the basic adaptation rules for intervention frequency and visualization detail based on the self-selected expertise level.
    *   Focus on 2-3 key intervention points and visualization screens to apply these initial adaptations.
3.  **UI for Settings:**
    *   Create a settings panel where users can select their expertise level and adjust the initial set of personalized preferences.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Personalization & Feedback
1.  **Expand Personalized Settings:**
    *   Introduce more granular settings as outlined in section 4 (e.g., toggling specific suggestion types).
2.  **Implement Feedback Mechanism:**
    *   Allow users to rate or provide brief feedback on Roo Code's suggestions and interventions.
3.  **Refine Adaptation Rules:**
    *   Use initial user feedback and observed usage (if basic telemetry is available) to refine the thresholds and behaviors for each expertise level.

### Phase 3: Implicit Expertise Modeling & Advanced Features (Long-term)
1.  **Develop Telemetry System (with user consent):**
    *   Collect anonymized data on feature usage, interaction patterns, error resolution paths, etc.
2.  **Build Implicit Expertise Model:**
    *   Use machine learning techniques to analyze telemetry data and infer or suggest adjustments to a user's expertise level.
3.  **Introduce Advanced Adaptive Features:**
    *   Dynamic adjustment of UI complexity.
    *   Personalized learning paths or suggestions for using Roo Code more effectively.
    *   More sophisticated, context-aware interventions.

### Roo Code Repository Context:
*   The existing Roo Code repository (`https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code`) structure will need to be analyzed to determine the best placement for new UI components (for settings) and logic for adaptive behaviors.
*   If a user profile system exists, these settings should be integrated there. Otherwise, a new module for user preferences will be needed.

## 6. Examples: Novice vs. Expert

**Scenario 1: A common syntax error is detected.**

*   **Novice User:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Error flagged prominently with a simple explanation.
    *   **Intervention:** "It looks like there's a missing semicolon on line 42. This is a common JavaScript error. Would you like me to add it for you? [Yes] [No] [Learn more about semicolons]"
    *   **Visualization:** The error message is clear, non-technical. The relevant line of code is highlighted with a suggestion.
*   **Expert User:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Error flagged concisely.
    *   **Intervention:** Minimal. Perhaps a subtle indicator or a quick-fix option available on hover. "SyntaxError: Missing semicolon (line 42)."
    *   **Visualization:** Error message is technical and direct. Highlighting is precise. No lengthy explanation unless requested.

**Scenario 2: Roo Code identifies a potentially inefficient code pattern.**

*   **Novice User:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Pattern flagged with an explanation of why it might be inefficient and what a better alternative could be.
    *   **Intervention:** "The way you're looping here might be a bit slow for large datasets. Consider using a `for...of` loop for better readability and potentially performance. [Show example] [Learn more about loops]"
    *   **Visualization:** Compares the current pattern with a suggested alternative, highlighting differences and benefits.
*   **Expert User:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Pattern flagged, perhaps with a link to performance implications if significant.
    *   **Intervention:** "Inefficient loop pattern detected (lines 60-65). Consider alternative for large N. [Details...]" (Details might link to a performance profile or a more technical explanation of the specific inefficiency).
    *   **Visualization:** Focuses on the performance metrics or complexity analysis if available. Assumes user can evaluate and refactor if deemed necessary.

## 7. Conclusion

Implementing expertise-adaptive monitoring will significantly enhance Roo Code's usability and effectiveness. By starting with explicit self-assessment and gradually introducing more sophisticated personalization and implicit modeling, Roo Code can evolve to become a truly intelligent assistant that respects and adapts to the diverse skill levels of its users. This aligns with the core insight of catering differently to "vibe coders" and "weathered engineers," ensuring that all users receive the right level of support at the right time.
